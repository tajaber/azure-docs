# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Korn Ferry ALP

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Korn Ferry ALP with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Korn Ferry ALP with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Korn Ferry ALP.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Korn Ferry ALP with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Korn Ferry ALP single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Korn Ferry ALP supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Korn Ferry ALP from the gallery

To configure the integration of Korn Ferry ALP into Azure AD, you need to add Korn Ferry ALP from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Korn Ferry ALP** in the search box.
1. Select **Korn Ferry ALP** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Korn Ferry ALP

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Korn Ferry ALP using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Korn Ferry ALP.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Korn Ferry ALP, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Korn Ferry ALP SSO](#configure-korn-ferry-alp-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Korn Ferry ALP test user](#create-korn-ferry-alp-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Korn Ferry ALP that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Korn Ferry ALP** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:
   
    a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:
	
   | **Identifier** |
   |-------|
   | `https://intappextin01/portalweb/sso/client/audience?guid=<customerguid>` |
   | `https://qaassessment.kfnaqa.com/portalweb/sso/client/audience?guid=<customerguid>` |
   | `https://assessments.kornferry.com/portalweb/sso/client/audience?guid=<customerguid>` |
    
	b. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

   | **Sign on URL** |
   |------|
   | `https://intappextin01/portalweb/sso/client/audience?guid=<customerguid>` |
   | `https://qaassessment.kfnaqa.com/portalweb/sso/client/audience?guid=<customerguid>` |
   | `https://assessments.kornferry.com/portalweb/sso/client/audience?guid=<customerguid>` |

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Sign on URL. Contact [Korn Ferry ALP Client support team](mailto:noreply@kornferry.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

4. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Korn Ferry ALP.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Korn Ferry ALP**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Korn Ferry ALP SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Korn Ferry ALP** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Korn Ferry ALP support team](mailto:noreply@kornferry.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Korn Ferry ALP test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Korn Ferry ALP. Work with [Korn Ferry ALP support team](mailto:noreply@kornferry.com) to add the users in the Korn Ferry ALP platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Korn Ferry ALP Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Korn Ferry ALP Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Korn Ferry ALP tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Korn Ferry ALP Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Korn Ferry ALP you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
