# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with PageDNA

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate PageDNA with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate PageDNA with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to PageDNA.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to PageDNA with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with PageDNA, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure subscription, [create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.
* A PageDNA subscription with single sign-on enabled.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD. For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment and integrate PageDNA with Azure AD.

PageDNA supports the following features:

* SP-initiated single sign-on (SSO).

* Just-in-time user provisioning.

## Add PageDNA from the Azure Marketplace

To configure the integration of PageDNA into Azure AD, you need to add PageDNA from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **PageDNA** in the search box.
1. Select **PageDNA** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for PageDNA

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with PageDNA using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in PageDNA.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with PageDNA, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure PageDNA SSO](#configure-pagedna-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create PageDNA test user](#create-pagedna-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in PageDNA that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **PageDNA** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    1. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** box, type a URL by using one of the following patterns:

        | **Identifier** |
        |------|
        |`https://stores.pagedna.com/<your site>/saml2ep.cgi`|
        |`https://www.nationsprint.com/<your site>/saml2ep.cgi`|

    1. In the **Sign on URL** box, type a URL by using one of the following patterns:

        | **Sign on URL** |
        |---------|
        |`https://stores.pagedna.com/<your site>`|
        |`https://<your domain>`|
        |`https://<your domain>/<your site>` |
        |`https://www.nationsprint.com/<your site>`|

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values aren't real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Sign on URL. To get these values, contact the [PageDNA support team](mailto:success@pagedna.com). You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** pane in the Azure portal.

1. In the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** pane, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select **Download** to download **Certificate (Raw)** from the given options and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate (Raw) download option.](common/certificateraw.png "Certificate")

1. In the **Set up PageDNA** section, copy the URL or URLs that you need:

    ![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate U R L.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to PageDNA.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **PageDNA**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure PageDNA SSO

To configure single sign-on on the PageDNA side, send the downloaded Certificate (Raw) and the appropriate copied URLs from the Azure portal to the [PageDNA support team](mailto:success@pagedna.com). The PageDNA team will make sure the SAML SSO connection is set properly on both sides.

### Create PageDNA test user

A user named Britta Simon is now created in PageDNA. You don't have to do anything to create this user. PageDNA supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. If a user named Britta Simon doesn't already exist in PageDNA, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to PageDNA Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to PageDNA Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the PageDNA tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to PageDNA Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure PageDNA you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
