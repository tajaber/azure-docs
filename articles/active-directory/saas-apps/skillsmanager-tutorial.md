# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Skills Manager

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Skills Manager with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Skills Manager with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Skills Manager.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Skills Manager with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Skills Manager single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Skills Manager supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Skills Manager from the gallery

To configure the integration of Skills Manager into Azure AD, you need to add Skills Manager from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Skills Manager** in the search box.
1. Select **Skills Manager** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Skills Manager

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Skills Manager using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Skills Manager.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Skills Manager, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Skills Manager SSO](#configure-skills-manager-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Skills Manager test user](#create-skills-manager-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Skills Manager that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Skills Manager** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.skills-manager.com/kennametal`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.skills-manager.com/public/SamlLogin2.aspx`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [Skills Manager Client support team](https://www.ibm.com/support/uk/?lnk=msu_uk) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Skills Manager.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Skills Manager**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Skills Manager SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Skills Manager** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Skills Manager support team](https://www.ibm.com/support/uk/?lnk=msu_uk). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Skills Manager test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Skills Manager. Work with [Skills Manager support team](https://www.ibm.com/support/uk/?lnk=msu_uk) to add the users in the Skills Manager platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Skills Manager for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Skills Manager tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Skills Manager for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Skills Manager you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
