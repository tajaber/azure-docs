# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Tendium

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Tendium with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Tendium with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Tendium.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Tendium with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Tendium single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Tendium supports **SP** initiated SSO.
* Tendium supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Tendium from the gallery

To configure the integration of Tendium into Azure AD, you need to add Tendium from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Tendium** in the search box.
1. Select **Tendium** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Tendium

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Tendium using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Tendium.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Tendium, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Tendium SSO](#configure-tendium-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Tendium test user](#create-tendium-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Tendium that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Tendium** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.

    `urn:amazon:cognito:sp:eu-west-1_bIV0Yblnt`
    
    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://auth-prod.app.tendium.com/saml2/idpresponse`

    c. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://app.tendium.com/auth/sign-in`

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Tendium.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Tendium**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Tendium SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Tendium** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [Tendium support team](mailto:tech-partners@tendium.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.You can also contact Tendium [here](https://tendium.ai/contact/) for more information.

### Create Tendium test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Tendium. Tendium supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Tendium, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Tendium Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Tendium Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Tendium tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Tendium Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Tendium you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
