# Tutorial: Azure Active Directory integration with Work.com

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Work.com with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Work.com with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Work.com.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Work.com with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Work.com, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* Work.com single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Work.com supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Work.com from the gallery

To configure the integration of Work.com into Azure AD, you need to add Work.com from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Work.com** in the search box.
1. Select **Work.com** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Work.com

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Work.com using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Work.com.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Work.com, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    2. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Work.com SSO](#configure-workcom-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Work.com test user](#create-workcom-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Work.com that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Work.com** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `http://<companyname>.my.salesforce.com`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Work.com Client support team](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=000159855&type=3) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

## Next steps

Once you configure Work.com you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
