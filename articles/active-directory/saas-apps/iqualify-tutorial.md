# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with iQualify LMS

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate iQualify LMS with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate iQualify LMS with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to iQualify LMS.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to iQualify LMS with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* iQualify LMS single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* iQualify LMS supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* iQualify LMS supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add iQualify LMS from the gallery

To configure the integration of iQualify LMS into Azure AD, you need to add iQualify LMS from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **iQualify LMS** in the search box.
1. Select **iQualify LMS** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for iQualify LMS

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with iQualify LMS using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in iQualify LMS.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with iQualify LMS, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure iQualify LMS SSO](#configure-iqualify-lms-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create iQualify LMS test user](#create-iqualify-lms-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in iQualify LMS that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **iQualify LMS** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

   a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using one the following patterns:

    | **Identifier** |
    |------|
    | Production Environment: `https://<yourorg>.iqualify.com/` |
    | Test Environment: `https://<yourorg>.iqualify.io` |

   b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | **Reply URL** |
    |--------|
    | Production Environment: `https://<yourorg>.iqualify.com/auth/saml2/callback` |
    | Test Environment: `https://<yourorg>.iqualify.io/auth/saml2/callback` |

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

   In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | **Sign-on URL** |
    |-------|
    | Production Environment: `https://<yourorg>.iqualify.com/login` |
    | Test Environment: `https://<yourorg>.iqualify.io/login` |

   > [!NOTE]
   > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [iQualify LMS Client support team](https://www.iqualify.com/) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Your iQualify LMS application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes. Click **Edit** icon to open **User Attributes** dialog.

    ![Screenshot shows User Attributes with the Edit icon selected.](common/edit-attribute.png "Attributes")

## Next steps

Once you configure iQualify LMS you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
