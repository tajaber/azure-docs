# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Benefitsolver

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Benefitsolver with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Benefitsolver with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Benefitsolver.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Benefitsolver with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Benefitsolver single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Benefitsolver supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Benefitsolver from the gallery

To configure the integration of Benefitsolver into Azure AD, you need to add Benefitsolver from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Benefitsolver** in the search box.
1. Select **Benefitsolver** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Benefitsolver

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Benefitsolver using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Benefitsolver.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Benefitsolver, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Benefitsolver SSO](#configure-benefitsolver-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Benefitsolver test user](#create-benefitsolver-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Benefitsolver that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Benefitsolver** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.

> [!NOTE]
> Your Benefitsolver support team has to do the actual SSO configuration. You will get a notification when SSO has been enabled for your subscription.

### Create Benefitsolver test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Benefitsolver. Work withÂ [Benefitsolver support team](https://www.businessolver.com/contact) to add the users in the Benefitsolver platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Benefitsolver Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Benefitsolver Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Benefitsolver tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Benefitsolver Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Benefitsolver you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâs sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
