# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Thoughtworks Mingle

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Thoughtworks Mingle with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Thoughtworks Mingle with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Thoughtworks Mingle.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Thoughtworks Mingle with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Thoughtworks Mingle, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Thoughtworks Mingle single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Thoughtworks Mingle supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Thoughtworks Mingle from the gallery

To configure the integration of Thoughtworks Mingle into Azure AD, you need to add Thoughtworks Mingle from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Thoughtworks Mingle** in the search box.
1. Select **Thoughtworks Mingle** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Thoughtworks Mingle

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Thoughtworks Mingle using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Thoughtworks Mingle.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Thoughtworks Mingle, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    2. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure Thoughtworks Mingle SSO](#configure-thoughtworks-mingle-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Thoughtworks Mingle test user](#create-thoughtworks-mingle-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Thoughtworks Mingle that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

## Next steps

Once you configure Thoughtworks Mingle you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
