# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location: the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud into Azure AD, you need to add Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.

### Create Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud. Work withÂ [Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud support team](https://www.splunk.com/en_us/about-splunk/contact-us.html) to add the users in the Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure Azure AD SSO for Splunk Enterprise and Splunk Cloud you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
