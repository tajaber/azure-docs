# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Profit.co

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Profit.co with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Profit.co with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Profit.co.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed in to Profit.co with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location, the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Profit.co single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Profit.co supports IDP initiated SSO.

## Add Profit.co from the gallery

To configure the integration of Profit.co into Azure AD, you need to add Profit.co from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal by using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Go to **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add a new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Profit.co** in the search box.
1. Select **Profit.co** from the results panel, and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Profit.co

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Profit.co by using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, establish a linked relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Profit.co.

Here are the general steps to configure and test Azure AD SSO with Profit.co:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Profit.co SSO](#configure-profitco-sso)** to configure the single sign-on settings on the application side.
    1. **[Create a Profit.co test user](#create-a-profitco-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Profit.co. This counterpart is linked to the Azure AD representation of the user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Profit.co** application integration page, find the **Manage** section. Select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. In the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the application is preconfigured and the necessary URLs are already pre-populated in Azure. Users need to save the configuration by selecting the **Save** button.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, select the **Copy** button. This copies the **App Federation Metadata Url** and saves it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory** > **Users** > **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's shown in the **Password** field.
   1. Select **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Profit.co.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications** > **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Profit.co**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section, and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**. In the **Add Assignment** dialog box, select **Users and groups**.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog box, select **B.Simon** from the users list. Then choose the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog box, select the appropriate role for the user from the list. Then choose the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog box, select **Assign**.

## Configure Profit.co SSO

To configure single sign-on on the Profit.co side, you need to send the App Federation Metadata URL to the [Profit.co support team](mailto:support@profit.co). They configure this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create a Profit.co test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Profit.co. Work with the [Profit.co support team](mailto:support@profit.co) to add the users in the Profit.co platform. You can't use single sign-on until you create and activate users.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Profit.co for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Profit.co tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the Profit.co for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Profit.co you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
