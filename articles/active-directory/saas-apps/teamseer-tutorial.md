# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with TeamSeer

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate TeamSeer with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate TeamSeer with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to TeamSeer.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to TeamSeer with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with TeamSeer, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* TeamSeer single sign-on enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* TeamSeer supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add TeamSeer from the gallery

To configure the integration of TeamSeer into Azure AD, you need to add TeamSeer from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **TeamSeer** in the search box.
1. Select **TeamSeer** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for TeamSeer

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with TeamSeer using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in TeamSeer.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with TeamSeer, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure TeamSeer SSO](#configure-teamseer-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create TeamSeer test user](#create-teamseer-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in TeamSeer that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **TeamSeer** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following step:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.teamseer.com/<companyid>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The value is not real. Update the value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [TeamSeer Client support team](https://pages.theaccessgroup.com/solutions_business-suite_absence-management_contact.html) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to TeamSeer Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to TeamSeer Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the TeamSeer tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to TeamSeer Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure TeamSeer you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
