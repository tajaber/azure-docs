# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Huddle

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Huddle with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Huddle with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Huddle.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Huddle with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Huddle single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Huddle supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Huddle from the gallery

To configure the integration of Huddle into Azure AD, you need to add Huddle from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Huddle** in the search box.
1. Select **Huddle** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Huddle

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Huddle using a test user called **B. Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Huddle.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Huddle, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** to enable your users to use this feature.
	1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** to test Azure AD single sign-on with B. Simon.
	1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** to enable B. Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Huddle SSO](#configure-huddle-sso)** to configure the SSO settings on application side.
	1. **[Create Huddle test user](#create-huddle-test-user)** to have a counterpart of B. Simon in Huddle that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Huddle** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **Single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a Single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

	> [!NOTE]
	> Your huddle instance will be automatically detected from the domain you enter below.

    a. In the **Identifier** text box,type one of the following URLs:

    | **Identifier** |
    |------|
    | `https://login.huddle.net` |
    | `https://login.huddle.com` |

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type one of the following URLs:

    | **Reply URL** |
    |----|
    | `https://login.huddle.net/saml/browser-sso` |
    | `https://login.huddle.com/saml/browser-sso` |
    | `https://login.huddle.com/saml/idp-initiated-sso` |

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following patterns:

    | **Sign-on URL** |
    |----|
    | `https://<customsubdomain>.huddle.com` |
    | `https://us.huddle.com` |
      
	> [!NOTE]
	> The Sign-on URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Sign-On URL. Contact [Huddle Client support team](https://huddle.zendesk.com) to get this value.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B. Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B. Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B. Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B. Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Huddle.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Huddle**.

1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Huddle SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Huddle** side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Huddle support team](https://huddle.zendesk.com/). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

> [!NOTE]
> Single sign-on needs to be enabled by the Huddle support team. You get a notification when the configuration has been completed.

### Create Huddle test user

To enable Azure AD users to log in to Huddle, they must be provisioned into Huddle. In the case of Huddle, provisioning is a manual task.

**To configure user provisioning, perform the following steps:**

1. Log in to your **Huddle** company site as administrator.

2. Click **Workspace**.

3. Click **People \> Invite People**.

	![People](./media/huddle-tutorial/tasks.png "People")

4. In the **Create a new invitation** section, perform the following steps:
  
	![New Invitation](./media/huddle-tutorial/team.png "New Invitation")
  
	a. In the **Choose a team to invite people to join** list, select **team**.

	b. Type the **Email Address** of a valid Azure AD account you want to provision in to **Enter email address for people you'd like to invite** textbox.

	c. Click **Invite**.

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Azure AD account holder will receive an email including a link to confirm the account before it becomes active.

> [!NOTE]
> You can use any other Huddle user account creation tools or APIs provided by Huddle to provision Azure AD user accounts.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Huddle Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Huddle Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Huddle for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Huddle tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Huddle for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Huddle you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
