# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with S4 - Digitsec

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate S4 - Digitsec with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate S4 - Digitsec with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to S4 - Digitsec.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to S4 - Digitsec with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* S4 - Digitsec single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* S4 - Digitsec supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* S4 - Digitsec supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add S4 - Digitsec from the gallery

To configure the integration of S4 - Digitsec into Azure AD, you need to add S4 - Digitsec from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **S4 - Digitsec** in the search box.
1. Select **S4 - Digitsec** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for S4 - Digitsec

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with S4 - Digitsec using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in S4 - Digitsec.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with S4 - Digitsec, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure S4 - Digitsec SSO](#configure-s4---digitsec-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create S4 - Digitsec test user](#create-s4---digitsec-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in S4 - Digitsec that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **S4 - Digitsec** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:
    
    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://s4.digitsec.com`

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Base64)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/certificatebase64.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up S4 - Digitsec** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to S4 - Digitsec.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **S4 - Digitsec**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure S4 - Digitsec SSO

To configure single sign-on on S4 - Digitsec side, you need to send the downloaded **Certificate (Base64)** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [S4 - Digitsec support team](mailto:Support@digitsec.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create S4 - Digitsec test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in S4 - Digitsec. S4 - Digitsec supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in S4 - Digitsec, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to S4 - Digitsec Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to S4 - Digitsec Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the S4 - Digitsec for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the S4 - Digitsec tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the S4 - Digitsec for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure S4 - Digitsec you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
