# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay

In this article, you learn how to integrate Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Proactis Rego is a powerful Source-to-Pay software platform designed for mid-market organizations. It's easy to use and integrate, giving you control over your spend and supply-chain risks. When you integrate Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You are able to configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay in a test environment. Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay supports **SP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay from the Azure AD gallery

Add Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with Proactis Rego Source-to-Pay. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal.
