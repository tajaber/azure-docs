# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Communifire

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Communifire with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Communifire with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Communifire.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Communifire with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Communifire single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Azure AD US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Azure AD US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Communifire supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.

* Communifire supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add Communifire from the gallery

To configure the integration of Communifire into Azure AD, you need to add Communifire from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Communifire** in the search box.
1. Select **Communifire** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Communifire

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Communifire using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Communifire.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Communifire, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Communifire SSO](#configure-communifire-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Communifire test user](#create-communifire-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Communifire that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Communifire** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, If you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.communifire.com`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.communifire.com/SAML/AssertionConsumerService.aspx`

5. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.communifire.com/login`

    > [!NOTE]
    > These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Communifire Client support team](mailto:support@axerosolutions.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

6. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Communifire.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Communifire**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Communifire SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Communifire** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Communifire support team](mailto:support@axerosolutions.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Communifire test user

The objective of this section is to create a user called Britta Simon in Communifire. Communifire supports **just-in-time provisioning**, which is by default enabled. A new user is created after saving the profile details during an attempt to access Communifire if it doesn't exist yet.

>[!Note]
>If you need to create a user manually, Contact [Communifire support team](mailto:support@axerosolutions.com).

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Communifire Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Communifire Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Communifire for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Communifire tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Communifire for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Communifire you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
