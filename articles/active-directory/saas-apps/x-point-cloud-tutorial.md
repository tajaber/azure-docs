# Tutorial: Azure A SSO integration with X-point Cloud

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate X-point Cloud with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate X-point Cloud with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to X-point Cloud.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to X-point Cloud with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* X-point Cloud single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* X-point Cloud supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add X-point Cloud from the gallery

To configure the integration of X-point Cloud into Azure AD, you need to add X-point Cloud from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **X-point Cloud** in the search box.
1. Select **X-point Cloud** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for X-point Cloud

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with X-point Cloud using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in X-point Cloud.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with X-point Cloud, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure X-point Cloud SSO](#configure-x-point-cloud-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create X-point Cloud test user](#create-x-point-cloud-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in X-point Cloud that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **X-point Cloud** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.atledcloud.jp`

    b. In the **Reply URL (Assertion Consumer Service URL)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.atledcloud.jp/xpoint/saml/acs`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.atledcloud.jp/xpoint`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Identifier, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Please match the `<SUBDOMAIN>` part of `https://<SUBDOMAIN>.atledcloud.jp` with the URL of the X-point you are using. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Certificate (Raw)** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

1. On the **Set up X-point Cloud** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to X-point Cloud.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **X-point Cloud**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure X-point Cloud SSO

To configure single sign-on on the X-point Cloud side, you can use the downloaded **Certificate (Raw)** and the **Login URL** copied from the Azure portal into the **SAML service settings** in the X-point Cloud domain management menu. Set to Certificate of public key used by IdP to sign and SSO endpoint URL for IdP.

### Create X-point Cloud test user

In this section, you can use the **email addresses** of users registered with Azure AD in X-point Cloud.
Create a user who has removed @ and beyond.
For example "username@companydomain.extension", add "username" to X-point Cloud,
Before you can use single sign-on, you must create and enable users.


## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to X-point Cloud Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to X-point Cloud Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the X-point Cloud tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to X-point Cloud Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure X-point Cloud you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
