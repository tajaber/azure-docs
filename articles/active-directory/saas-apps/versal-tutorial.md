# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Versal

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Versal with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Versal with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Versal.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Versal with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Versal single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Versal supports **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Versal from the gallery

To configure the integration of Versal into Azure AD, you need to add Versal from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Versal** in the search box.
1. Select **Versal** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Versal

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Versal using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Versal.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Versal, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Versal SSO](#configure-versal-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Versal test user](#create-versal-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Versal that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Versal** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** page, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type the value:
    `VERSAL`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://versal.com/sso/saml/orgs/<organization_id>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Reply URL value is not real. Update this value with the actual Reply URL. Contact Versal Client support team to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Versal application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **nameidentifier** is mapped with **user.userprincipalname**. Versal application expects **nameidentifier** to be mapped with **user.mail**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Versal** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Versal.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Versal**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Versal SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Versal** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to Versal support team. They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Versal test user

In this section, you create a user called B.Simon in Versal. Follow the Creating a SAML test user support guide to create the user B.Simon within your organization. Users must be created and activated in Versal before you use single sign-on. 

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration using a Versal course embedded within your website.
Please see the Embedding Organizational Courses **SAML Single Sign-On**
support guide for instructions on how to embed a Versal course with support for Azure AD single sign-on. 

You will need to create a course, share it with your organization, and publish it in order to test course embedding. 

## Next steps

Once you configure Versal you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
