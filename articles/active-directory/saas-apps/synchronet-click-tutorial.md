# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with SynchroNet CLICK

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate SynchroNet CLICK with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate SynchroNet CLICK with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to SynchroNet CLICK.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to SynchroNet CLICK with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* SynchroNet CLICK single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* SynchroNet CLICK supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add SynchroNet CLICK from the gallery

To configure the integration of SynchroNet CLICK into Azure AD, you need to add SynchroNet CLICK from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **SynchroNet CLICK** in the search box.
1. Select **SynchroNet CLICK** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for SynchroNet CLICK

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with SynchroNet CLICK using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in SynchroNet CLICK.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with SynchroNet CLICK, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure SynchroNet CLICK SSO](#configure-synchronet-click-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create SynchroNet CLICK test user](#create-synchronet-click-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in SynchroNet CLICK that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **SynchroNet CLICK** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following step:

	In the **Sign on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://click.synchronet.com`

1. SynchroNet CLICK application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes, where as **emailaddress** is mapped with **user.mail**. SynchroNet CLICK application expects **emailaddress** to be mapped with **user.userprincipalname**, so you need to edit the attribute mapping by clicking on **Edit** icon and change the attribute mapping.

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, In the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to SynchroNet CLICK.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **SynchroNet CLICK**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you're expecting any role value in the SAML assertion, in the **Select Role** dialog, select the appropriate role for the user from the list and then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure SynchroNet CLICK SSO

To configure single sign-on on **SynchroNet CLICK** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [SynchroNet CLICK support team](mailto:tickets@synchronet.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create SynchroNet CLICK test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in SynchroNet CLICK. Work with [SynchroNet CLICK support team](mailto:tickets@synchronet.com) to add the users in the SynchroNet CLICK platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to SynchroNet CLICK Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to SynchroNet CLICK Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the SynchroNet CLICK tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to SynchroNet CLICK Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure SynchroNet CLICK you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
