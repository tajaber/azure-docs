# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Timetabling Solutions

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Timetabling Solutions with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Timetabling Solutions with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Timetabling Solutions.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Timetabling Solutions with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Timetabling Solutions single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Timetabling Solutions supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Timetabling Solutions from the gallery

To configure the integration of Timetabling Solutions into Azure AD, you need to add Timetabling Solutions from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Timetabling Solutions** in the search box.
1. Select **Timetabling Solutions** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Timetabling Solutions

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Timetabling Solutions using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Timetabling Solutions.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Timetabling Solutions, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Timetabling Solutions SSO](#configure-timetabling-solutions-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Timetabling Solutions test user](#create-timetabling-solutions-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Timetabling Solutions that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Next steps

Once you configure Timetabling Solutions you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
