# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with AnswerHub

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate AnswerHub with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate AnswerHub with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to AnswerHub.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to AnswerHub with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* AnswerHub single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* AnswerHub supports SP-initiated SSO.

## Add AnswerHub from the gallery

To configure the integration of AnswerHub into Azure AD, you need to add AnswerHub from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **AnswerHub** in the search box.
1. Select **AnswerHub** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Set up and test Azure AD SSO for AnswerHub

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with AnswerHub using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in AnswerHub.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with AnswerHub, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure AnswerHub SSO](#configure-answerhub-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create AnswerHub test user](#create-answerhub-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in AnswerHub that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **AnswerHub** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Go to AnswerHub Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the AnswerHub tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to AnswerHub Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure AnswerHub you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
