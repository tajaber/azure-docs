# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Fidelity PlanViewer

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Fidelity PlanViewer with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Fidelity PlanViewer with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Fidelity PlanViewer.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Fidelity PlanViewer with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Fidelity PlanViewer single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Fidelity PlanViewer supports **SP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Fidelity PlanViewer from the gallery

To configure the integration of Fidelity PlanViewer into Azure AD, you need to add Fidelity PlanViewer from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Fidelity PlanViewer** in the search box.
1. Select **Fidelity PlanViewer** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Fidelity PlanViewer

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Fidelity PlanViewer using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Fidelity PlanViewer.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Fidelity PlanViewer, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Fidelity PlanViewer SSO](#configure-fidelity-planviewer-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Fidelity PlanViewer test user](#create-fidelity-planviewer-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Fidelity PlanViewer that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Fidelity PlanViewer** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic SAML Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type the value:
    `sp.fidelityworldwideinvestments.com`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://sso.sp.fidelity.co.uk/sp/ACS.saml2 `

    c. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://cat-idr560.fidelity.co.uk/planviewer/jsp/home.jsp`

1. Fidelity PlanViewer application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![Screenshot shows the image of Fidelity PlanViewer application attributes.](common/edit-attribute.png "Mapping")

1. In addition to above, Fidelity PlanViewer application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response, which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirement.

	| Name |  Source Attribute |
	|-------| --------- |
    | LAST_NAME | user.surname |

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Fidelity PlanViewer** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate URLs.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Attributes")    

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Fidelity PlanViewer.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Fidelity PlanViewer**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Fidelity PlanViewer SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Fidelity PlanViewer** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Fidelity PlanViewer support team](mailto:service.delivery@fil.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Fidelity PlanViewer test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Fidelity PlanViewer. Work with [Fidelity PlanViewer support team](mailto:service.delivery@fil.com) to add the users in the Fidelity PlanViewer platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Fidelity PlanViewer Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Fidelity PlanViewer Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Fidelity PlanViewer tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Fidelity PlanViewer Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Fidelity PlanViewer you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
