# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Dealpath

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Dealpath with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Dealpath with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Dealpath.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Dealpath with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Dealpath single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Dealpath supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Dealpath from the gallery

To configure the integration of Dealpath into Azure AD, you need to add Dealpath from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Dealpath** in the search box.
1. Select **Dealpath** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Dealpath

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Dealpath using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Dealpath.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Dealpath, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Dealpath SSO](#configure-dealpath-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Dealpath test user](#create-dealpath-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Dealpath that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Dealpath** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

4. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

	a. In the **Sign on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://app.dealpath.com/account/login`

    b. In the **Identifier (Entity ID)** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://api.dealpath.com/saml/metadata/<ID>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> The Identifier value is not real. Update the value with the actual Identifier. Contact [Dealpath Client support team](mailto:kenter@dealpath.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

4. On the **Set-up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Certificate (Base64)** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Dealpath.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Dealpath**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Dealpath SSO

1. In a different web browser window, sign in to Dealpath as an Administrator.

2. In the top right, click **Admin Tools** and navigate to **Integrations**, then in **SAML 2.0 Authentication** section click **Update Settings**:

	![Screenshot that shows the "Admin Tools - Integrations" page with the "S A M L 2.0 Authentication" section and "Update Settings" selected.](./media/dealpath-tutorial/admin.png)

	![Screenshot that shows Dealpath Configuration.](./media/dealpath-tutorial/configuration.png) 

	a. In the **SAML SSO URL** textbox, paste the value of **Login URL**, which you have copied from Azure portal.

	b. In the **Identity Provider Issuer** textbox, paste the value of **Azure Ad Identifier**,  which you have copied from Azure portal.

	c. Copy the content of the downloaded **certificate(Base64)** file in notepad, and then paste it into the **Public Certificate** textbox.

	d. Click **Update settings**.

### Create Dealpath test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Dealpath. Work with [Dealpath Client support team](mailto:kenter@dealpath.com) to add the users in the Dealpath platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Dealpath Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to Dealpath Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the Dealpath tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to Dealpath Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Dealpath you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
