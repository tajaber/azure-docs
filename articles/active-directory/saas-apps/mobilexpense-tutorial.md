# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Mobile Xpense

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Mobile Xpense with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Mobile Xpense with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Mobile Xpense.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Mobile Xpense with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Mobile Xpense single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Mobile Xpense supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Add Mobile Xpense from the gallery

To configure the integration of Mobile Xpense into Azure AD, you need to add Mobile Xpense from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Mobile Xpense** in the search box.
1. Select **Mobile Xpense** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Mobile Xpense

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Mobile Xpense using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Mobile Xpense.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Mobile Xpense, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Mobile Xpense SSO](#configure-mobile-xpense-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Mobile Xpense test user](#create-mobile-xpense-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Mobile Xpense that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Mobile Xpense** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** text box, type the URL:
    `https://mobilexpense.com/ServiceProvider`

    b. In the **Reply URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<subdomain>.mobilexpense.com/NET/SSO/SAML20/SAML/AssertionConsumerService.aspx`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step, if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://<sub-domain>.mobilexpense.com/<customername>`

	> [!NOTE]
	> These values are not real. Update these values with the actual Reply URL and Sign-on URL. Contact [Mobile Xpense Client support team](https://www.mobilexpense.com/contact) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

	![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Mobile Xpense** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) as per your requirement.

### Create an Azure AD test user 

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Mobile Xpense.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Mobile Xpense**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Mobile Xpense SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Mobile Xpense** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Mobile Xpense support team](https://www.mobilexpense.com/contact). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Mobile Xpense test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in Mobile Xpense. Work with [Mobile Xpense support team](https://www.mobilexpense.com/contact) to add the users in the Mobile Xpense platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Mobile Xpense Sign-On URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Mobile Xpense Sign-On URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Mobile Xpense for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Mobile Xpense tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application Sign-On page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Mobile Xpense for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Mobile Xpense you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organization’s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
