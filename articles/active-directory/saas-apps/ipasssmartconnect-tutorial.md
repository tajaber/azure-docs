# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with iPass SmartConnect

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate iPass SmartConnect with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate iPass SmartConnect with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to iPass SmartConnect.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to iPass SmartConnect with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* iPass SmartConnect single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

> [!NOTE]
> This integration is also available to use from Azure AD US Government Cloud environment. You can find this application in the Azure AD US Government Cloud Application Gallery and configure it in the same way as you do from public cloud.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* iPass SmartConnect supports **SP and IDP** initiated SSO.
* iPass SmartConnect supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.
* iPass SmartConnect supports [Automated user provisioning](ipass-smartconnect-provisioning-tutorial.md).


> [!NOTE]
> Identifier of this application is a fixed string value so only one instance can be configured in one tenant.

## Adding iPass SmartConnect from the gallery

To configure the integration of iPass SmartConnect into Azure AD, you need to add iPass SmartConnect from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **iPass SmartConnect** in the search box.
1. Select **iPass SmartConnect** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for iPass SmartConnect

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with iPass SmartConnect using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in iPass SmartConnect.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with iPass SmartConnect, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure iPass SmartConnect SSO](#configure-ipass-smartconnect-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create iPass SmartConnect test user](#create-ipass-smartconnect-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in iPass SmartConnect that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **iPass SmartConnect** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

   ![Edit Basic SAML Configuration](common/edit-urls.png)

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, if you wish to configure the application in **IDP** initiated mode, the user does not have to perform any step as the app is already pre-integrated with Azure.

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL:
    `https://om-activation.ipass.com/ClientActivation/ssolanding.go`

1. Click **Save**.

1. iPass SmartConnect application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

	![image](common/default-attributes.png)

1. In addition to above, iPass SmartConnect application expects few more attributes to be passed back in SAML response which are shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

	| Name |  Source Attribute|
	| ---------------| ----------|
	| firstName | user.givenname |
	| lastName | user.surname |
	| email | user.userprincipalname |
	| username | user.userprincipalname |

1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to iPass SmartConnect.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **iPass SmartConnect**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure iPass SmartConnect SSO

To configure single sign-on on **iPass SmartConnect** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [iPass SmartConnect support team](mailto:help@ipass.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create iPass SmartConnect test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in iPass SmartConnect. Work with [iPass SmartConnect support team](mailto:help@ipass.com) to add the users or the domain that must be added to an allow list for the iPass SmartConnect platform. If the domain is added by the team, users will get automatically provisioned to the iPass SmartConnect platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to iPass SmartConnect Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow.

* Go to iPass SmartConnect Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the iPass SmartConnect for which you set up the SSO

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the iPass SmartConnect tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the iPass SmartConnect for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure iPass SmartConnect you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-any-app).
