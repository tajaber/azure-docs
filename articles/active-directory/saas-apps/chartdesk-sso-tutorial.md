# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with ChartDesk SSO

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate ChartDesk SSO with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). ChartDesk SSO allows your users to sign in to ChartDesk using Microsoft Azure AD credentials. When you integrate ChartDesk SSO with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to ChartDesk SSO.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ChartDesk SSO with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for ChartDesk SSO in a test environment. ChartDesk SSO supports **IDP** initiated single sign-on.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with ChartDesk SSO, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* ChartDesk SSO single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the ChartDesk SSO application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add ChartDesk SSO from the Azure AD gallery

Add ChartDesk SSO from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with ChartDesk SSO. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **ChartDesk SSO** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | **Identifier** |
    |---------------|
    |`https://<CustomerTenantID>.staging-api.chartdesk.net/saml/metadata` |
    | `https://<CustomerTenantID>.prod-api.chartdesk.net/saml/metadata` |
    | `https://<CustomerTenantID>.prod-api.chartdesk.de/saml/metadata` |

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using one of the following patterns:

    | **Reply URL** |
    |------------|
    |`https://<CustomerTenantID>.staging-api.chartdesk.net/saml/consume` |
    | `https://<CustomerTenantID>.prod-api.chartdesk.net/saml/consume` |
    | `https://<CustomerTenantID>.prod-api.chartdesk.de/saml/consume` |

    > [!Note]
    > These values are not the real. Update these values with the actual Identifier and Reply URL. Contact [ChartDesk SSO Client support team](mailto:support@chartdesk.pro) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.
    
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click copy button to copy **App Federation Metadata Url** and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/copy-metadataurl.png "Certificate")

## Configure ChartDesk SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ChartDesk SSO** side, you need to send the **App Federation Metadata Url** to [ChartDesk SSO support team](mailto:support@chartdesk.pro). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ChartDesk SSO test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in ChartDesk SSO. Work with [ChartDesk SSO support team](mailto:support@chartdesk.pro) to add the users in the ChartDesk SSO platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options.

* Click on Test this application in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the ChartDesk SSO for which you set up the SSO.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the ChartDesk SSO tile in the My Apps, you should be automatically signed in to the ChartDesk SSO for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure ChartDesk SSO you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
