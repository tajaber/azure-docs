# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with ForeSee CX Suite

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate ForeSee CX Suite with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate ForeSee CX Suite with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to ForeSee CX Suite.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to ForeSee CX Suite with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.


## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with ForeSee CX Suite, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/)
* ForeSee CX Suite single sign-on enabled subscription

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* ForeSee CX Suite supports **SP** initiated SSO.

* ForeSee CX Suite supports **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Add ForeSee CX Suite from the gallery

To configure the integration of ForeSee CX Suite into Azure AD, you need to add ForeSee CX Suite from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **ForeSee CX Suite** in the search box.
1. Select **ForeSee CX Suite** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for ForeSee CX Suite

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with ForeSee CX Suite using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in ForeSee CX Suite.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with ForeSee CX Suite, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    2. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
2. **[Configure ForeSee CX Suite SSO](#configure-foresee-cx-suite-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create ForeSee CX Suite test user](#create-foresee-cx-suite-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in ForeSee CX Suite that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
3. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **ForeSee CX Suite** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    ![Upload metadata file](common/upload-metadata.png)

	b. Click on **folder logo** to select the metadata file and click **Upload**.

	![choose metadata file](common/browse-upload-metadata.png)

	c. After the metadata file is successfully uploaded, the **Identifier** value gets auto populated in Basic SAML Configuration section.

	d. In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type a URL:
    `https://cxsuite.foresee.com/`

	e. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern: https:\//www.okta.com/saml2/service-provider/\<UniqueID>

	> [!Note]
	> If the **Identifier** value do not get auto polulated, then please fill in the value manually according to above pattern. The Identifier value is not real. Update this value with the actual Identifier. Contact [ForeSee CX Suite Client support team](mailto:support@foresee.com) to get this value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

5. On the **Set up Single Sign-On with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, click **Download** to download the **Federation Metadata XML** from the given options as per your requirement and save it on your computer.

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
2. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
3. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:

   3. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   4. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to ForeSee CX Suite.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
2. In the applications list, select **ForeSee CX Suite**.

7. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure ForeSee CX Suite SSO

To configure single sign-on on **ForeSee CX Suite** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [ForeSee CX Suite support team](mailto:support@foresee.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create ForeSee CX Suite test user

In this section, you create a user called Britta Simon in ForeSee CX Suite. Work with [ForeSee CX Suite support team](mailto:support@foresee.com) to add the users or the domain that must be added to an allowlist for the ForeSee CX Suite platform. If the domain is added by the team, users will get automatically provisioned to the ForeSee CX Suite platform. Users must be created and activated before you use single sign-on.

## Test SSO

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to ForeSee CX Suite Sign-on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to ForeSee CX Suite Sign-on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the ForeSee CX Suite tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to ForeSee CX Suite Sign-on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](https://support.microsoft.com/account-billing/sign-in-and-start-apps-from-the-my-apps-portal-2f3b1bae-0e5a-4a86-a33e-876fbd2a4510).

## Next steps

Once you configure ForeSee CX Suite you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Defender for Cloud Apps](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
