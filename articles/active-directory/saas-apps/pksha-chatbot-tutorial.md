# Azure Active Directory SSO integration with PKSHA Chatbot

In this article, you'll learn how to integrate PKSHA Chatbot with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). PKSHA Chatbot is an AI-based interaction solution with a chat interface that can be embedded in a website. When you integrate PKSHA Chatbot with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to PKSHA Chatbot.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to PKSHA Chatbot with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

You'll configure and test Azure AD single sign-on for PKSHA Chatbot in a test environment. PKSHA Chatbot supports only **SP** initiated single sign-on and **Just In Time** user provisioning.

## Prerequisites

To integrate Azure Active Directory with PKSHA Chatbot, you need:

* An Azure AD user account. If you don't already have one, you can [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
* One of the following roles: Global Administrator, Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator, or owner of the service principal.
* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* PKSHA Chatbot single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.

## Add application and assign a test user

Before you begin the process of configuring single sign-on, you need to add the PKSHA Chatbot application from the Azure AD gallery. You need a test user account to assign to the application and test the single sign-on configuration.

### Add PKSHA Chatbot from the Azure AD gallery

Add PKSHA Chatbot from the Azure AD application gallery to configure single sign-on with PKSHA Chatbot. For more information on how to add application from the gallery, see the [Quickstart: Add application from the gallery](../manage-apps/add-application-portal.md).

### Create and assign Azure AD test user

Follow the guidelines in the [create and assign a user account](../manage-apps/add-application-portal-assign-users.md) article to create a test user account in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, and assign roles. The wizard also provides a link to the single sign-on configuration pane in the Azure portal. [Learn more about Microsoft 365 wizards.](/microsoft-365/admin/misc/azure-ad-setup-guides). 

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Complete the following steps to enable Azure AD single sign-on in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **PKSHA Chatbot** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, select the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a value using the following pattern:
    `urn:auth0:bedore-idp-production:<CONNECTION_NAME>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://login.admin.workplace.bedore.jp/login/callback?connection=<CONNECTION_NAME>`

    c. In the **Sign on URL** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://admin.workplace.bedore.jp?organization=<ORGANIZATION_CODE>`

    > [!Note]
    > These values are not the real. Update these values with the actual Identifer, Reply URL and Sign on URL. Contact [PKSHA Chatbot Client support team](mailto:bedore-support@pkshatech.com) to get these values. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section, find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up PKSHA Chatbot** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows how to copy configuration appropriate URL.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Metadata")

## Configure PKSHA Chatbot SSO

To configure single sign-on on **PKSHA Chatbot** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [PKSHA Chatbot support team](mailto:isd.bedore-support@pkshatech.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create PKSHA Chatbot test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in PKSHA Chatbot. PKSHA Chatbot supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in PKSHA Chatbot, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to PKSHA Chatbot Sign on URL where you can initiate the login flow. 

* Go to PKSHA Chatbot Sign on URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

* You can use Microsoft My Apps. When you click the PKSHA Chatbot tile in the My Apps, this will redirect to PKSHA Chatbot Sign on URL. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure PKSHA Chatbot you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
