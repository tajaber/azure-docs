# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Settling music

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Settling music with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Settling music with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Settling music.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Settling music with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To configure Azure AD integration with Settling music, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have an Azure AD environment, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Settling music single sign-on enabled subscription.

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD single sign-on in a test environment.

* Settling music supports **SP** initiated SSO.

## Add Settling music from the gallery

To configure the integration of Settling music into Azure AD, you need to add Settling music from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Settling music** in the search box.
1. Select **Settling music** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Settling music

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Settling music using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Settling music.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Settling music, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Settling music SSO](#configure-settling-music-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Settling music test user](#create-settling-music-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Settling music that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Settling music** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
