# Tutorial: Azure AD SSO integration with Articulate 360

In this tutorial, you'll learn how to integrate Articulate 360 with Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). When you integrate Articulate 360 with Azure AD, you can:

* Control in Azure AD who has access to Articulate 360.
* Enable your users to be automatically signed-in to Articulate 360 with their Azure AD accounts.
* Manage your accounts in one central location - the Azure portal.

## Prerequisites

To get started, you need the following items:

* An Azure AD subscription. If you don't have a subscription, you can get a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).
* Articulate 360 single sign-on (SSO) enabled subscription.
* Along with Cloud Application Administrator, Application Administrator can also add or manage applications in Azure AD.
For more information, see [Azure built-in roles](../roles/permissions-reference.md).

## Scenario description

In this tutorial, you configure and test Azure AD SSO in a test environment.

* Articulate 360 supports **SP** and **IDP** initiated SSO.

## Add Articulate 360 from the gallery

To configure the integration of Articulate 360 into Azure AD, you need to add Articulate 360 from the gallery to your list of managed SaaS apps.

1. Sign in to the Azure portal using either a work or school account, or a personal Microsoft account.
1. On the left navigation pane, select the **Azure Active Directory** service.
1. Navigate to **Enterprise Applications** and then select **All Applications**.
1. To add new application, select **New application**.
1. In the **Add from the gallery** section, type **Articulate 360** in the search box.
1. Select **Articulate 360** from results panel and then add the app. Wait a few seconds while the app is added to your tenant.

 Alternatively, you can also use the [Enterprise App Configuration Wizard](https://portal.office.com/AdminPortal/home?Q=Docs#/azureadappintegration). In this wizard, you can add an application to your tenant, add users/groups to the app, assign roles, as well as walk through the SSO configuration as well.

## Configure and test Azure AD SSO for Articulate 360

Configure and test Azure AD SSO with Articulate 360 using a test user called **B.Simon**. For SSO to work, you need to establish a link relationship between an Azure AD user and the related user in Articulate 360.

To configure and test Azure AD SSO with Articulate 360, perform the following steps:

1. **[Configure Azure AD SSO](#configure-azure-ad-sso)** - to enable your users to use this feature.
    1. **[Create an Azure AD test user](#create-an-azure-ad-test-user)** - to test Azure AD single sign-on with B.Simon.
    1. **[Assign the Azure AD test user](#assign-the-azure-ad-test-user)** - to enable B.Simon to use Azure AD single sign-on.
1. **[Configure Articulate 360 SSO](#configure-articulate-360-sso)** - to configure the single sign-on settings on application side.
    1. **[Create Articulate 360 test user](#create-articulate-360-test-user)** - to have a counterpart of B.Simon in Articulate 360 that is linked to the Azure AD representation of user.
1. **[Test SSO](#test-sso)** - to verify whether the configuration works.

## Configure Azure AD SSO

Follow these steps to enable Azure AD SSO in the Azure portal.

1. In the Azure portal, on the **Articulate 360** application integration page, find the **Manage** section and select **single sign-on**.
1. On the **Select a single sign-on method** page, select **SAML**.
1. On the **Set up single sign-on with SAML** page, click the pencil icon for **Basic SAML Configuration** to edit the settings.

    ![Screenshot shows to edit Basic S A M L Configuration.](common/edit-urls.png "Basic Configuration")

1. On the **Basic SAML Configuration** section, perform the following steps:

    a. In the **Identifier** textbox, type a URL using the following pattern:
    `https://www.okta.com/saml2/service-provider/<SAMPLE>`

    b. In the **Reply URL** textbox, type the URL:
    `https://id.articulate.com/sso/saml2`

1. Click **Set additional URLs** and perform the following step if you wish to configure the application in **SP** initiated mode:    

    In the **Sign-on URL** text box, type the URL:
    `https://id.articulate.com/`

    > [!Note]
    > The Identifier value is not real. Update this value with the actual Identifier. Contact [Articulate 360 support team](mailto:enterprise@articulate.com) to get the value. You can also refer to the patterns shown in the **Basic SAML Configuration** section in the Azure portal.

1. Articulate 360 application expects the SAML assertions in a specific format, which requires you to add custom attribute mappings to your SAML token attributes configuration. The following screenshot shows the list of default attributes.

    ![Screenshot shows the image of attributes.](common/default-attributes.png "Attributes")

1. Articulate 360 application expects the default attributes to be replaced with the specific attributes as shown below. These attributes are also pre populated but you can review them as per your requirements.

    | Name | Source Attribute|
    | ------------ | --------- |    
    | firstName | user.givenname |
    | lastName | user.surname |
    | email | user.mail |

1. On the **Set-up single sign-on with SAML** page, in the **SAML Signing Certificate** section,  find **Federation Metadata XML** and select **Download** to download the certificate and save it on your computer.

    ![Screenshot shows the Certificate download link.](common/metadataxml.png "Certificate")

1. On the **Set up Articulate 360** section, copy the appropriate URL(s) based on your requirement.

	![Screenshot shows to copy configuration appropriate U R L.](common/copy-configuration-urls.png "Attributes")  

### Create an Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll create a test user in the Azure portal called B.Simon.

1. From the left pane in the Azure portal, select **Azure Active Directory**, select **Users**, and then select **All users**.
1. Select **New user** at the top of the screen.
1. In the **User** properties, follow these steps:
   1. In the **Name** field, enter `B.Simon`.  
   1. In the **User name** field, enter the username@companydomain.extension. For example, `B.Simon@contoso.com`.
   1. Select the **Show password** check box, and then write down the value that's displayed in the **Password** box.
   1. Click **Create**.

### Assign the Azure AD test user

In this section, you'll enable B.Simon to use Azure single sign-on by granting access to Articulate 360.

1. In the Azure portal, select **Enterprise Applications**, and then select **All applications**.
1. In the applications list, select **Articulate 360**.
1. In the app's overview page, find the **Manage** section and select **Users and groups**.
1. Select **Add user**, then select **Users and groups** in the **Add Assignment** dialog.
1. In the **Users and groups** dialog, select **B.Simon** from the Users list, then click the **Select** button at the bottom of the screen.
1. If you are expecting a role to be assigned to the users, you can select it from the **Select a role** dropdown. If no role has been set up for this app, you see "Default Access" role selected.
1. In the **Add Assignment** dialog, click the **Assign** button.

## Configure Articulate 360 SSO

To configure single sign-on on **Articulate 360** side, you need to send the downloaded **Federation Metadata XML** and appropriate copied URLs from Azure portal to [Articulate 360 support team](mailto:enterprise@articulate.com). They set this setting to have the SAML SSO connection set properly on both sides.

### Create Articulate 360 test user

In this section, a user called B.Simon is created in Articulate 360. Articulate 360 supports just-in-time user provisioning, which is enabled by default. There is no action item for you in this section. If a user doesn't already exist in Articulate 360, a new one is created after authentication.

## Test SSO 

In this section, you test your Azure AD single sign-on configuration with following options. 

#### SP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal. This will redirect to Articulate 360 Sign-On URL where you can initiate the login flow.  

* Go to Articulate 360 Sign-On URL directly and initiate the login flow from there.

#### IDP initiated:

* Click on **Test this application** in Azure portal and you should be automatically signed in to the Articulate 360 for which you set up the SSO. 

You can also use Microsoft My Apps to test the application in any mode. When you click the Articulate 360 tile in the My Apps, if configured in SP mode you would be redirected to the application sign-on page for initiating the login flow and if configured in IDP mode, you should be automatically signed in to the Articulate 360 for which you set up the SSO. For more information about the My Apps, see [Introduction to the My Apps](../user-help/my-apps-portal-end-user-access.md).

## Next steps

Once you configure Articulate 360 you can enforce session control, which protects exfiltration and infiltration of your organizationâ€™s sensitive data in real time. Session control extends from Conditional Access. [Learn how to enforce session control with Microsoft Cloud App Security](/cloud-app-security/proxy-deployment-aad).
