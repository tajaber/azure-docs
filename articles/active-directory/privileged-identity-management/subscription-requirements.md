# License requirements to use Privileged Identity Management

To use Privileged Identity Management (PIM) in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD), part of Microsoft Entra, a tenant must have a valid license. Licenses must also be assigned to the administrators and relevant users. This article describes the license requirements to use Privileged Identity Management.  To use Privileged Identity Management, you must have one of the following licenses:

- [!INCLUDE [active-directory-p2-governance-either-license.md](../../../includes/active-directory-p2-governance-either-license.md)]


## Valid licenses

You will need either Microsoft Entra ID Governance licenses or Azure AD Premium P2 licenses to use PIM and all of its settings. Currently, you can scope an access review to service principals with access to Azure AD and Azure resource roles with an Microsoft Entra Premuim P2 or Microsoft Entra ID Governance edition active in your tenant. The licensing model for service principals will be finalized for general availability of this feature and additional licenses may be required. 

## Licenses you must have
Ensure that your tenant has either Microsoft Entra ID Governance or Microsoft Azure AD Premium P2 licenses for all users whose identities or access is governed or who interact with an identity governance feature.


## Example license scenarios

Here are some example license scenarios to help you determine the number of licenses you must have.

| Scenario | Calculation | Number of licenses |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Woodgrove Bank has 10 administrators for different departments and 2 Global Administrators that configure and manage PIM. They make five administrators eligible. | Five licenses for the administrators who are eligible | 5 |
| Graphic Design Institute has 25 administrators of which 14 are managed through PIM. Role activation requires approval and there are three different users in the organization who can approve activations. | 14 licenses for the eligible roles + three approvers | 17 |
| Contoso has 50 administrators of which 42 are managed through PIM. Role activation requires approval and there are five different users in the organization who can approve activations. Contoso also does monthly reviews of users assigned to administrator roles and reviewers are the usersâ€™ managers of which six are not in administrator roles managed by PIM. | 42 licenses for the eligible roles + five approvers + six reviewers | 53 |

## When a license expires

If a Microsoft Azure AD Premuim P2, Microsoft Entra ID Governance, or trial license expires, Privileged Identity Management features will no longer be available in your directory:

- Permanent role assignments to Azure AD roles will be unaffected.
- The Privileged Identity Management service in the Azure portal, as well as the Graph API cmdlets and PowerShell interfaces of Privileged Identity Management, will no longer be available for users to activate privileged roles, manage privileged access, or perform access reviews of privileged roles.
- Eligible role assignments of Azure AD roles will be removed, as users will no longer be able to activate privileged roles.
- Any ongoing access reviews of Azure AD roles will end, and Privileged Identity Management configuration settings will be removed.
- Privileged Identity Management will no longer send emails on role assignment changes.
