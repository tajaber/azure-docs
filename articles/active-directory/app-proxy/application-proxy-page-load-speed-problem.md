# An Application Proxy application takes too long to load

This article helps you to understand why an Azure AD Application Proxy application may take a long time to load. It also explains what you can do to resolve this issue.

## Overview
Although your applications are working, they can experience a long latency. There might be network topology tweaks that you can make to improve speed. For an evaluation of different topologies, see the [network considerations document](application-proxy-network-topology.md).

Besides network topology, there are currently no further recommendations for performance tuning. As the Application Proxy service expands it might come to a data center that is physically closer. The closer proximity might help with latency. For a list of Azure data centers, see the [latency test page](http://www.azurespeed.com/Azure/Latency).
