# Troubleshoot HR user update issues

## Null and empty values not processed as expected
**Applies to:**
* Workday to on-premises Active Directory user provisioning
* Workday to Azure Active Directory user provisioning
* SAP SuccessFactors to on-premises Active Directory user provisioning
* SAP SuccessFactors to Azure Active Directory user provisioning

| Troubleshooting | Details |
|-- | -- |
| **Issue** | You have successfully configured the inbound provisioning app. You are getting null or empty value from the HR app. You expect the provisioning service to clear the corresponding target attribute value in on-premises Active Directory / Azure AD. But the operation fails with the error message: `InvalidAttributeSyntax-LdapErr: The syntax is invalid. The parameter is incorrect. Error in attribute conversion operation, data 0, v3839` |
| **Cause** | The provisioning service does not have a default logic for null value processing. When the provisioning service gets an empty string from the source app, it tries to flow the value "as-is" to the target app. In this case, on-premises Active Directory does not support setting empty string values and hence you see the above error. |
| **Resolution** | Check the provisioning logs. Identify attributes in the target Active Directory that are receiving null or empty string values. Update the attribute mapping for such attributes to use an expression mapping. See recommended resolutions below. |

**Recommended resolutions**

  Let's say the attribute `BusinessTitle` mapped to AD attribute `jobTitle` may be null or empty in Workday. 
  * Option 1: Define an expression to check for empty or null values using functions like [IIF](functions-for-customizing-application-data.md#iif), [IsNullOrEmpty](functions-for-customizing-application-data.md#isnullorempty), [Coalesce](functions-for-customizing-application-data.md#coalesce) or [IsPresent](functions-for-customizing-application-data.md#ispresent) and pass a non-blank literal value. 
  
     `IIF(IsNullOrEmpty([BusinessTitle]),"N/A",[BusinessTitle])`

  * Option 2: Use the function [IgnoreFlowIfNullOrEmpty](functions-for-customizing-application-data.md#ignoreflowifnullorempty) to drop empty or null attributes in the payload sent to on-premises Active Directory / Azure AD. 
  
     `IgnoreFlowIfNullOrEmpty([BusinessTitle])` 

## Some Workday attribute updates are missing
**Applies to:**
* Workday to on-premises Active Directory user provisioning
* Workday to Azure Active Directory user provisioning

| Troubleshooting | Details |
|-- | -- |
| **Issue** | You have successfully configured the Workday inbound provisioning app and successfully connected to the Workday tenant URL. You are observing that there is a delay in the flow of certain attribute updates from Workday or in some cases, the attributes changes from Workday are not flowing through as expected during incremental sync. |
| **Cause** | During incremental sync, the provisioning app queries Workday transaction log for changes to the primary Worker entity and only changes tracked by Workday's transaction log are processed. <br> If changes to a Workday attribute in your setup is not tracked by Workday's transaction log, then Azure AD will not be able to fetch that change. For example: the *LocalReference* Workday attribute is part of the default attribute mapping and it has XPATH `wd:Worker/wd:Worker_Data/wd:Employment_Data/wd:Position_Data/wd:Business_Site_Summary_Data/wd:Local_Reference/wd:ID[@wd:type='Locale_ID']/text()`. Note that this attribute is part of the entity *Business_Site_Summary_Data*. A change in the value of this attribute in Workday will not show up in the Workday transaction log. Thus during incremental sync, the new value of this attribute will show up only if an attribute associated with the primary Worker entity also changes during the sync interval. |
| **Resolution** | If you notice this behavior frequently, where changes to certain Workday attributes are not flowing through, we recommend periodically running a weekly or monthly full sync. |

## User match with extensionAttribute not working
**Applies to:**
* Workday to Azure Active Directory user provisioning
* SAP SuccessFactors to Azure Active Directory user provisioning

| Troubleshooting | Details |
|-- | -- |
| **Issue** | Let's say you are using *extensionAttribute3* in Azure AD to store the employee ID and you have mapped it to Workday *WorkerID* or SuccessFactors *personIdExternal* attribute for user matching. With this configuration, the matching step in provisioning process fails. This issue impacts both user creation and updates. |
| **Cause** | The Azure AD *OnPremisesExtensionAttributes* (`extensionAttributes1-15`) cannot be used as a matching attribute because the `$filter` parameter of **Azure AD Graph API** does not [support filtering by extensionAttributes](/previous-versions/azure/ad/graph/howto/azure-ad-graph-api-supported-queries-filters-and-paging-options#filter). |
| **Resolution** | Don't use Azure AD *OnPremisesExtensionAttributes* (`extensionAttributes1-15`) in the matching attribute pair. Use employeeID. |
