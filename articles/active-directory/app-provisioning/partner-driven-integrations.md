# Partner-driven provisioning integrations

The Azure Active Directory Provisioning service allows you to provision users and groups into both [SaaS](user-provisioning.md) and [on-premises](on-premises-scim-provisioning.md) applications. There are four integration paths:

**Option 1 - Azure AD Application Gallery:**
Popular third party applications, such as Dropbox, Snowflake, and Workplace by Facebook, are made available for customers through the Azure AD application gallery. New applications can easily be onboarded to the gallery using the [application network portal](../manage-apps/v2-howto-app-gallery-listing.md). 

**Option 2 - Implement a SCIM compliant API for your application:**
If your line-of-business application supports the [SCIM](https://aka.ms/scimoverview) standard, it can easily be integrated with the [Azure AD SCIM client](use-scim-to-provision-users-and-groups.md).

**Option 3 - Use Microsoft Graph:**
Many new applications use Microsoft Graph to retrieve users, groups and other resources from Azure Active Directory. You can learn more about what scenarios to use [SCIM and Graph](scim-graph-scenarios.md) in. 

**Option 4 - Use partner-driven connectors:**
In cases where an application doesn't support SCIM, partners have built gateways between the Azure AD SCIM client and target applications. **This document serves as a place for partners to attest to integrations that are compatible with Azure Active Directory, and for customers to discover these partner-driven integrations.** These gateways are built, maintained, and owned by the third-party vendor.

## Available partner-driven integrations
The descriptions and lists of applications below are provided by the partners themselves. You can use the lists of applications supported to identify a partner that you may want to contact and learn more about.  

### IDMWORKS
