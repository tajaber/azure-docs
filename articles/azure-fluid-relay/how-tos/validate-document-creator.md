# How to: Validate a user who created a container

When you create a container in Azure Fluid Relay, the JWT provided by the [ITokenProvider](https://fluidframework.com/docs/apis/azure-client/itokenprovider-interface) for the creation request can only be used once. After creating a container, the client must generate a new JWT that contains the document ID (which is really the container ID) provided by the service at creation time. If an application has an authorization service that manages container access control, it will need to know who created a container with a given ID in order to authorize the generation of a new JWT for access to that container.

## Inform an authorization service when a container is created

An application can tie into the container creation lifecycle by implementing a public [documentPostCreateCallback()](https://fluidframework.com/docs/apis/azure-client/itokenprovider-interface#documentpostcreatecallback-methodsignature) method in its `TokenProvider`. (The name of this function can be confusing. It is really a callback for post *container* creation.) This callback will be triggered directly after creating the container, before a client requests the new JWT it needs to gain read/write permissions to the container that was created.

The `documentPostCreateCallback()` receives two parameters: 1) the ID of the container that was created (also called the "document ID") and 2) a JWT signed by the service with no permission scopes. The authorization service can verify the given JWT and use the information in the JWT to grant the correct user permissions for the newly created container.

### Create an endpoint for your container creation callback

This example below is an [Azure Function](../../azure-functions/functions-overview.md) based off the example in [How to: Write a TokenProvider with an Azure Function](azure-function-token-provider.md#create-an-endpoint-for-your-tokenprovider-using-azure-functions).

```typescript
import { AzureFunction, Context, HttpRequest } from "@azure/functions";
import { ITokenClaims, IUser } from "@fluidframework/protocol-definitions";
import * as jwt from "jsonwebtoken";

// NOTE: retrieve the key from a secure location.
const key = "myTenantKey";

const httpTrigger: AzureFunction = async function (context: Context, req: HttpRequest): Promise<void> {
    const token = (req.query.token || (req.body && req.body.token)) as string;
    const documentId = (req.query.documentId || (req.body && req.body.documentId)) as string;

    if (!token) {
        context.res = {
            status: 400,
            body: "No token provided in request",
        };
        return;
    }
    if (!documentId) {
        context.res = {
            status: 400,
            body: "No documentId provided in request",
        };
        return;
    }
    
    const claims = jwt.decode(token) as ITokenClaims;
    if (!claims) {
        context.res = {
            status: 403,
            body: "Missing token claims",
        };
        return;
    }

    const tenantId = claims.tenantId;
    if (!claims) {
        context.res = {
            status: 400,
            body: "No tenantId provided in token claims",
        };
        return;
    }
    if (!key) {
        context.res = {
            status: 404,
            body: `No key found for the provided tenantId: ${tenantId}`,
        };
        return;
    }
    try {
        jwt.verify(token, key);
    } catch (e) {
        if (e instanceof jwt.TokenExpiredError) {
            context.res = {
                status: 401,
                body: `Token is expired`,
            };
            return
        }
        context.res = {
            status: 403,
            body: `Token signed with invalid key`,
        }
        return;
    }

    const user: IUser = claims.user;
    // Pseudo-function: implement according to your needs
    giveUserPermissionsForContainer(documentId, user);

    context.res = {
        status: 200,
        body: "OK",
    };
};

export default httpTrigger;
```

### Implement the `documentPostCreateCallback`

This example implementation below extends the [AzureFunctionTokenProvider](https://fluidframework.com/docs/apis/azure-client/azurefunctiontokenprovider-class) and uses the [axios](https://www.npmjs.com/package/axios) library to make a HTTP request to the Azure Function used for generating tokens.

```typescript
import { AzureFunctionTokenProvider, AzureMember } from "@fluidframework/azure-client";
import axios from "axios";

/**
 * Token Provider implementation for connecting to an Azure Function endpoint for
 * Azure Fluid Relay token resolution.
 */
export class AzureFunctionTokenProviderWithContainerCreateCallback extends AzureFunctionTokenProvider {
    /**
     * Creates a new instance using configuration parameters.
     * @param azFunctionUrl - URL to Azure Function endpoint
     * @param user - User object
     */
    constructor(
        private readonly authAzFunctionUrl: string,
        azFunctionUrl: string,
        user?: Pick<AzureMember, "userId" | "userName" | "additionalDetails">,
    ) {
        super(azFunctionUrl, user);
    }

    // In this context, a document is another name for container, so you can think of this function
    // as if it were named containerPostCreateCallback.
    public async documentPostCreateCallback?(documentId: string, creationToken: string): Promise<void> {
        await axios.post(this.authAzFunctionUrl, {
            params: {
                documentId,
                token: creationToken,
            },
        });
    }
}
```
