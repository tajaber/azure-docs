# Scale an App Service app manually using Azure CLI

This sample script creates a resource group, an App Service plan, and an app. It then scales the App Service plan from a single instance to multiple instances.

[!INCLUDE [quickstarts-free-trial-note](../../../includes/quickstarts-free-trial-note.md)]

[!INCLUDE [azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md](~/articles/reusable-content/azure-cli/azure-cli-prepare-your-environment.md)]

## Sample script

[!INCLUDE [cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md](../../../includes/cli-launch-cloud-shell-sign-in.md)]

### Run the script

:::code language="azurecli" source="~/azure_cli_scripts/app-service/scale-manual/scale-manual.sh" id="FullScript":::

## Clean up resources

[!INCLUDE [cli-clean-up-resources.md](../../../includes/cli-clean-up-resources.md)]

```azurecli
az group delete --name $resourceGroup
```

## Sample reference

This script uses the following commands to create a resource group, App Service app, and all related resources. Each command in the table links to command specific documentation.

| Command | Notes |
