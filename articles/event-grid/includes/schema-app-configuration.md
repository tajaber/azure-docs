## Available event types

Event Grid uses [event subscriptions](../concepts.md#event-subscriptions) to route event messages to subscribers. Azure App Configuration emits the following event types: 

| Event type | Description |
| ---------- | ----------- |
| Microsoft.AppConfiguration.KeyValueModified | Raised when a key-value is created or replaced. |
| Microsoft.AppConfiguration.KeyValueDeleted | Raised when a key-value is deleted. |

## Event schema

# [Event Grid event schema](#tab/event-grid-event-schema)
An event has the following top-level data:

| `eventTime` | string | The time the event is generated based on the provider's UTC time. |
| `id` | string | Unique identifier for the event. |
| `data` | object | App Configuration event data. |
| `dataVersion` | string | The schema version of the data object. The publisher defines the schema version. |
| `metadataVersion` | string | The schema version of the event metadata. Event Grid defines the schema of the top-level properties. Event Grid provides this value. |

## Example event

# [Event Grid event schema](#tab/event-grid-event-schema)
The following example shows the schema of a key-value modified event: 

```json
[{
  "id": "84e17ea4-66db-4b54-8050-df8f7763f87b",
  "topic": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testrg/providers/microsoft.appconfiguration/configurationstores/contoso",
  "subject": "https://contoso.azconfig.io/kv/Foo?label=FizzBuzz",
  "data": {
    "key": "Foo",
    "label": "FizzBuzz",
    "etag": "FnUExLaj2moIi4tJX9AXn9sakm0"
  },
  "eventType": "Microsoft.AppConfiguration.KeyValueModified",
  "eventTime": "2019-05-31T20:05:03Z",
  "dataVersion": "1",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```

The schema for a key-value deleted event is similar: 

```json
[{
  "id": "84e17ea4-66db-4b54-8050-df8f7763f87b",
  "topic": "/subscriptions/00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000/resourceGroups/testrg/providers/microsoft.appconfiguration/configurationstores/contoso",
  "subject": "https://contoso.azconfig.io/kv/Foo?label=FizzBuzz",
  "data": {
    "key": "Foo",
    "label": "FizzBuzz",
    "etag": "FnUExLaj2moIi4tJX9AXn9sakm0"
  },
  "eventType": "Microsoft.AppConfiguration.KeyValueDeleted",
  "eventTime": "2019-05-31T20:05:03Z",
  "dataVersion": "1",
  "metadataVersion": "1"
}]
```
