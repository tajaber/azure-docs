# Publish events to Azure Event Grid custom topics using access keys

This article describes how to post an event to a custom topic using an access key. It shows the format of the post and event data. The [Service Level Agreement (SLA)](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/sla/event-grid/v1_0/) only applies to posts that match the expected format.


> [!NOTE]
> Azure AD authentication provides a superior authentication support than that's offered by access key or Shared Access Signature (SAS) token authentication. With Azure AD authentication, the identity is validated against Azure AD identity provider. As a developer, you won't have to handle keys in your code if you use Azure AD authentication. you'll also benefit from all security features built into the Microsoft Identity platform, such as Conditional Access, that can help you improve your application's security stance. For more information, see [Authenticate publishing clients using Azure Active Directory](authenticate-with-active-directory.md).

## Endpoint

When sending the HTTP POST to a custom topic, use the URI format: `https://<topic-endpoint>?api-version=2018-01-01`. For example, a valid URI is: `https://exampletopic.westus2-1.eventgrid.azure.net/api/events?api-version=2018-01-01`. To get the endpoint for a custom topic using Azure CLI, use:

```azurecli-interactive
az eventgrid topic show --name <topic-name> -g <topic-resource-group> --query "endpoint"
```

To get the endpoint for a custom topic using Azure PowerShell, use:

```powershell
(Get-AzEventGridTopic -ResourceGroupName <topic-resource-group> -Name <topic-name>).Endpoint
```

## Header

In the request, include a header value named `aeg-sas-key` that contains a key for authentication. For example, a valid header value is `aeg-sas-key: xxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxxx`. To get the key for a custom topic using Azure CLI, use:

```azurecli
az eventgrid topic key list --name <topic-name> -g <topic-resource-group> --query "key1"
```

To get the key for a custom topic using PowerShell, use:

```powershell
(Get-AzEventGridTopicKey -ResourceGroupName <topic-resource-group> -Name <topic-name>).Key1
```

## Event data

For custom topics, the top-level data contains the same fields as standard resource-defined events. One of those properties is a `data` property that contains properties unique to the custom topic. As an event publisher, you determine properties for that data object. Here's the schema:

```json
[
  {
    "id": string,    
    "eventType": string,
    "subject": string,
    "eventTime": string-in-date-time-format,
    "data":{
      object-unique-to-each-publisher
    },
    "dataVersion": string
  }
]
```

For a description of these properties, see [Azure Event Grid event schema](event-schema.md). When posting events to an Event Grid topic, the array can have a total size of up to 1 MB. The maximum allowed size for an event is also 1 MB. Events over 64 KB are charged in 64-KB increments. When receiving events in a batch, the maximum allowed number of events is 5,000 per batch.

For example, a valid event data schema is:

```json
[{
  "id": "1807",
  "eventType": "recordInserted",
  "subject": "myapp/vehicles/motorcycles",
  "eventTime": "2017-08-10T21:03:07+00:00",
  "data": {
    "make": "Ducati",
    "model": "Monster"
  },
  "dataVersion": "1.0"
}]
```

## Response

After posting to the topic endpoint, you receive a response. The response is a standard HTTP response code. Some common responses are:

|Result  |Response  |
|---------|---------|
|Success  | 200 OK  |
|Event data has incorrect format | 400 Bad Request |
|Invalid access key | 401 Unauthorized |
|Incorrect endpoint | 404 Not Found |
|Array or event exceeds size limits | 413 Payload Too Large |

For errors, the message body has the following format:

```json
{
    "error": {
        "code": "<HTTP status code>",
        "message": "<description>",
        "details": [{
            "code": "<HTTP status code>",
            "message": "<description>"
    }]
  }
}
```
