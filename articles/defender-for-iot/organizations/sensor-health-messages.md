# Sensor health message reference

This article lists the sensor health messages displayed in the **Sites and sensors** page in the Azure portal.

For more information, see [Understand sensor health](how-to-manage-sensors-on-the-cloud.md#understand-sensor-health).

## Critical messages

|Title  |Message  |Description  |Recommendation  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**Disconnected**     |   This sensor isn't communicating with Azure     |      Sensor is disconnected   |   Try signing into the sensor to check for errors or networking failures. <br><br> We also recommend reviewing the sensor networking configuration and verifying the sensor’s ability to communicate with Azure.      |
|**Sanity failed**     |    This sensor failed an internal consistency check     |      Sensor fails sanity   |       The sensor is in a degraded state. <br><br> Check the sensor for hardware failures and try restarting the sensor.  If the issue isn't resolved, open a support ticket.  |
|**No traffic detected**     |   No traffic detected on the monitored network interfaces      |   No traffic detected      |  Check that the monitoring ports are connected to SPAN/monitor ports on the adjacent switch and that traffic is active on the link. At least one link with network traffic should be connected to the monitor ports.       |

## Warning messages

|Title  |Message  |Description  |Recommendation  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**Package upload failed** |There was an error uploading the file to the sensor |Upload error |Verify the sensor’s ability to communicate with download.microsoft.com and retry. <br><br> If the problem persists,  open a support ticket.|
|**Sensor update failed** | There was an error installing the update.| Installation error |Open a support ticket. |
| **Unstable traffic to Azure**|Sensor’s connection to Azure is unstable |Unstable traffic to Azure | We recommend that you check the sensor WAN connection, the BW limit settings, and validate network equipment that might be on the route between the sensor and the cloud.|
| **Outdated**|Outdated software may result in a non-optimal experience |Sensor version is outdated |Upgrade your sensor software to the latest version to use the most recently available Defender for IoT features.|

## Healthy messages

|Title  |Message  |Description  |Recommendation  |
|---------|---------|---------|---------|
|**Pending activation** |Waiting for sensor to connect for the first time |Pending activation | Upload the activation file to the sensor. If this doesn't resolve the problem, verify the sensor’s ability to communicate with Azure.|
|**Pending reactivation** |Waiting for reactivation with new license |Pending reactivation |Upload the new activation file to the sensor. If this doesn't resolve the problem, verify the sensor’s ability to communicate with Azure. |
