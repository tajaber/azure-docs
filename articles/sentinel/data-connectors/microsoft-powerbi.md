# Microsoft PowerBI connector for Microsoft Sentinel

Microsoft PowerBI is a collection of software services, apps, and connectors that work together to turn your unrelated sources of data into coherent, visually immersive, and interactive insights. Your data may be an Excel spreadsheet, a collection of cloud-based and on-premises hybrid data warehouses, or a data store of some other type. This connector lets you stream PowerBI audit logs into Microsoft Sentinel, allowing you to track user activities in your PowerBI environment. You can filter the audit data by date range, user, dashboard, report, dataset, and activity type.
