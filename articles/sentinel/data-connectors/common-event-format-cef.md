By connecting your CEF logs to Microsoft Sentinel, you can take advantage of search & correlation, alerting, and threat intelligence enrichment for each log. For more information, see the [Microsoft Sentinel documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/p/?linkid=2223902&wt.mc_id=sentinel_dataconnectordocs_content_cnl_csasci).
