# Tutorial: Add Security headers with Rules Engine

This tutorial shows how to implement security headers to prevent browser-based vulnerabilities like HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS), X-XSS-Protection, Content-Security-Policy, or X-Frame-Options. Security-based attributes can also be defined with cookies.

The following example shows you how to add a Content-Security-Policy header to all incoming requests that match the path defined in the route your Rules Engine configuration is associated with. Here, we only allow scripts from our trusted site, **https://apiphany.portal.azure-api.net** to run on our application.

In this tutorial, you learn how to:

## Prerequisites

* An Azure subscription.
* An Azure Front Door. To complete the steps in this tutorial, you must have a Front Door configured with rules engine. For more information, see [Quickstart: Create a Front Door](quickstart-create-front-door.md) and [Configure your Rules Engine](front-door-tutorial-rules-engine.md).

## Add a Content-Security-Policy header in Azure portal

1. Within your Front door resource, select **Rules engine configuration** under **Settings**, and then select the rules engine that you want to add the security header to.

2. Select **Add rule** to add a new rule. Provide the rule a name and then select **Add an Action** > **Response Header**.

3. Set the Operator to **Append** to add this header as a response to all of the incoming requests to this route.

4. Add the header name: *Content-Security-Policy* and define the values this header should accept, then select **Save**. In this scenario, we choose *`script-src 'self' https://apiphany.portal.azure-api.net`*.

   > [!NOTE]
   > Header values are limited to 640 characters.

5. Once you've added all of the rules you'd like to your configuration, don't forget to go to your preferred route and associate your Rules engine configuration to the Route Rule. This step is required to enable the rule to work.

    > [!NOTE]
    > In this scenario, we did not add [match conditions](front-door-rules-engine-match-conditions.md) to the rule. All incoming requests that match the path defined in the Route Rule will have this rule applied. If you would like it to only apply to a subset of those requests, be sure to add your specific **match conditions** to this rule.

## Clean up resources

In the previous steps, you configured security headers with rules engine of your Front Door. If you no longer want the rule, you can remove it by selecting **Delete rule** within the rules engine.
