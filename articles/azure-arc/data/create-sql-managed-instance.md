# Create an Azure Arc-enabled SQL Managed Instance

[!INCLUDE [azure-arc-common-prerequisites](../../../includes/azure-arc-common-prerequisites.md)]


## Create an Azure SQL Managed Instance

To view available options for create command for SQL Managed Instance, use the following command:
```azurecli
az sql mi-arc create --help
```

To create a SQL Managed Instance, use `az sql mi-arc create`. See the following examples for different connectivity modes:

> [!NOTE]
>  A ReadWriteMany (RWX) capable storage class needs to be specified for backups. Learn more about [access modes](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes/#access-modes)
If no storage class is specified for backups, the default storage class in Kubernetes is used and if this is not RWX capable, the Arc SQL Managed Instance installation may not succeed.

### [Directly connected mode](#tab/directly-connected-mode)

```azurecli
az sql mi-arc create --name <name> --resource-group <group> -–subscription <subscription>  --custom-location <custom-location> --storage-class-backups <RWX capable storageclass>
```

Example:

```azurecli
az sql mi-arc create --name sqldemo --resource-group rg -–subscription xxxxxxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxx-xxxxxxxxxxxx  --custom-location private-location --storage-class-backups mybackups
```


### [Indirectly connected mode](#tab/indirectly-connected-mode)

```azurecli
az sql mi-arc create -n <instanceName> --storage-class-backups <RWX capable storageclass>  --k8s-namespace <namespace> --use-k8s
```

Example:

```azurecli
az sql mi-arc create -n sqldemo --storage-class-backups mybackups --k8s-namespace my-namespace --use-k8s
```

> [!NOTE]
>  Names must be less than 60 characters in length and conform to [DNS naming conventions](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/overview/working-with-objects/names/#rfc-1035-label-names). 
>
>  When specifying memory allocation and vCore allocation use this formula to ensure your performance is acceptable: for each 1 vCore you should have at least 4GB of RAM of capacity available on the Kubernetes node where the SQL managed instance pod will run.
>
>  If you want to automate the creation of SQL instances and avoid the interactive prompt for the admin password, you can set the `AZDATA_USERNAME` and `AZDATA_PASSWORD` environment variables to the desired username and password prior to running the `az sql mi-arc create` command.
> 
>  If you created the data controller using AZDATA_USERNAME and AZDATA_PASSWORD in the same terminal session, then the values for AZDATA_USERNAME and AZDATA_PASSWORD will be used to create the SQL managed instance too.

> [!NOTE]
> If you are using the indirect connectivity mode, creating Azure SQL Managed Instance in Kubernetes will not automatically register the resources in Azure. Steps to register the resource are in the following articles:

## View instance on Azure Arc

To view the instance, use the following command:

```azurecli
az sql mi-arc list --k8s-namespace <namespace> --use-k8s
```

You can copy the external IP and port number from here and connect to it using your favorite tool for connecting to a SQL Sever/Azure SQL instance such as Azure Data Studio or SQL Server Management Studio.
