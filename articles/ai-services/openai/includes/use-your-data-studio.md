## Add your data using Azure OpenAI Studio

Navigate to [Azure OpenAI Studio](https://oai.azure.com/) and sign-in with credentials that have access to your Azure OpenAI resource. During or after the sign-in workflow, select the appropriate directory, Azure subscription, and Azure OpenAI resource.

1. Select the **Chat playground** tile.

1. In the pane that appears, select **Upload files** under **Select data source**. Select **Upload files**. Azure OpenAI needs both a storage resource and a search resource to access and index your data.

    > [!TIP]
    > * For a list of supported data sources, see [Data source options](../concepts/use-your-data.md#data-source-options)
    > *  For documents and datasets with long text, we recommend using the available [data preparation script](../concepts/use-your-data.md#ingesting-your-data-into-azure-cognitive-search). 

    1. For Azure OpenAI to access your storage account, you will need to turn on [Cross-origin resource sharing (CORS)](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?linkid=2237228). If CORS isn't already turned on for the Azure Blob storage resource, select **Turn on CORS**. 

    1. Select your Azure Cognitive Search resource, and select the acknowledgment that connecting it will incur usage on your account. Then select **Next**.

1. On the **Upload files** pane, select **Browse for a file** and select the files you want to upload. Then select **Upload files**. Then select **Next**.

1. Review the details you entered, and select **Save and close**. You can now chat with the model and it will use information from your data to construct the response.

## Chat playground

Start exploring Azure OpenAI capabilities with a no-code approach through the chat playground. It's simply a text box where you can submit a prompt to generate a completion. From this page, you can quickly iterate and experiment with the capabilities. 

:::image type="content" source="../media/quickstarts/chat-playground.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the playground page of the Azure OpenAI Studio with sections highlighted." lightbox="../media/quickstarts/chat-playground.png":::

You can experiment with the configuration settings such as temperature and pre-response text to improve the performance of your task. You can read more about each parameter in the [REST API](../reference.md).

- Selecting the **Generate** button will send the entered text to the completions API and stream the results back to the text box.
- Select the **Undo** button to undo the prior generation call.
- Select the **Regenerate** button to complete an undo and generation call together.
