A resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed. Use the [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) command to create a resource group named `myResourceGroup` in the `eastus` location.

```azurecli
az group create --name myResourceGroup --location EastUS
```
