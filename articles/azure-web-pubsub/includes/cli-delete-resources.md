If you plan to continue on to work with subsequent quickstarts and tutorials, you may wish to leave these resources in place.

When no longer needed, you can use the Azure CLI [az group delete](/cli/azure/group) command to remove the resource group and all related resources:

```azurecli-interactive
az group delete --name "myResourceGroup"
```
