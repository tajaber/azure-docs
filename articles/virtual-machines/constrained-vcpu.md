# Constrained vCPU capable VM sizes

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

> [!TIP]
> Try the **[Virtual Machine selector tool](https://aka.ms/vm-selector)** to find other sizes that best fit your workload.

Some database workloads like SQL Server require high memory, storage, and I/O bandwidth, but not a high number of cores. Many database workloads are not CPU-intensive. Azure offers pre-defined VM sizes with lower vCPU count which can help to reduce the cost of software licensing, while maintaining the same memory, storage, and I/O bandwidth.

The available vCPU count can be  reduced to one half or one quarter of the original VM specification. These new VM sizes have a suffix that specifies the number of available vCPUs to make them easier for you to identify. There are no additional cores available that can be used by the VM.

For example, the Standard_E32s_v5 VM size comes with 32 vCPUs, 256 GiB RAM, 32 disks, and 80,000 IOPs or 2 GB/s of I/O bandwidth. The pre-defined Standard_E32-16s_v5 and Standard_E32-8s_v5 VM sizes comes with 16 and 8 active vCPUs respectively, while maintaining the memory, storage, and I/O bandwidth specifications of the Standard_E32s_v5.

The licensing fees charged for SQL Server are based on the avaialble vCPU count. Third party products should count the available vCPU which represents the max to be used and licensed. This results in a 50% to 75% increase in the ratio of the VM specs to available (billable) vCPUs. At this time, the VM pricing, remains the same as the original size.
