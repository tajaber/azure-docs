# Epsv5 and Epdsv5-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The Epsv5-series and Epdsv5-series virtual machines are based on the Arm architecture, delivering outstanding price-performance for memory-intensive workloads. These virtual machines feature the Ampere® Altra® Arm-based processor operating at 3.0 GHz, which provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer a range of vCPU sizes, up to 8 GiB of memory per vCPU, and are best suited for memory-intensive scale-out and enterprise workloads, such as relational database servers, large databases, data analytics engines, in-memory caches, and more.

## Epsv5-series

Epsv5-series virtual machines feature the Ampere® Altra® Arm-based processor operating at 3.0 GHz, which provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer up to 32 vCPU and 208 GiB of RAM and are ideal for memory-intensive scale-out and most Enterprise workloads. Epsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types with no local-SSD support. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## Epdsv5-series

Epdsv5-series virtual machines feature the Ampere® Altra® Arm-based processor operating at 3.0 GHz, which provides an entire physical core for each virtual machine vCPU. These virtual machines offer up to 32 vCPU, 208 GiB of RAM, and fast local SSD storage up to 1,200 GiB and are ideal for memory-intensive scale-out and most Enterprise workloads. Epdsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).
