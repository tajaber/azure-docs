# Dv5 and Dsv5-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The Dv5 and Dsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a [hyper threaded](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. This new processor features an all core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). These virtual machines offer a combination of vCPUs and memory to meet the requirements associated with most enterprise workloads, such as small-to-medium databases, low-to-medium traffic web servers, application servers and more. The Dv5 and Dsv5-series provide a better value proposition for workloads that don't require local temp disk. For information about similar virtual machines with local disk, see [Ddv5 and Ddsv5-series VMs](ddv5-ddsv5-series.md).

> [!NOTE]
> For frequently asked questions, see  [Azure VM sizes with no local temp disk](azure-vms-no-temp-disk.yml).

## Dv5-series

Dv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz.  These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 384 GiB of RAM.  Dv5-series virtual machines provide a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation (for example, increased scalability and an upgraded CPU class).

Dv5-series virtual machines do not have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry.  You can attach Standard SSDs, and Standard HDDs disk storage to these virtual machines. To use Premium SSD or Ultra Disk storage, select Dsv5-series virtual machines. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## Dsv5-series

Dsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz.

Dsv5-series virtual machines provide a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation (for example, increased scalability and an upgraded CPU class).

Dsv5-series virtual machines do not have any temporary storage thus lowering the price of entry.  You can attach Standard SSDs, Standard HDDs, and Premium SSDs disk storage to these virtual machines. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines.
