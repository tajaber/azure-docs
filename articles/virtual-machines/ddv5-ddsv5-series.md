# Ddv5 and Ddsv5-series

**Applies to:** :heavy_check_mark: Linux VMs :heavy_check_mark: Windows VMs :heavy_check_mark: Flexible scale sets :heavy_check_mark: Uniform scale sets

The Ddv5 and Ddsv5-series Virtual Machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel&reg; Xeon&reg; Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor in a [hyper threaded](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/hyper-threading/hyper-threading-technology.html) configuration, providing a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads. This new processor features an all core turbo clock speed of 3.5 GHz with [Intel&reg; Turbo Boost Technology](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/turbo-boost/turbo-boost-technology.html), [Intel&reg; Advanced-Vector Extensions 512 (Intel&reg; AVX-512)](https://www.intel.com/content/www/us/en/architecture-and-technology/avx-512-overview.html) and [Intel&reg; Deep Learning Boost](https://software.intel.com/content/www/us/en/develop/topics/ai/deep-learning-boost.html). These virtual machines offer a combination of vCPUs, memory and temporary storage able to meet the requirements associated with most enterprise workloads, such as small-to-medium databases, low-to-medium traffic web servers, application servers and more.


## Ddv5-series
Ddv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz. These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 384 GiB of RAM as well as fast, local SSD storage up to 3,600 GiB. Ddv5-series virtual machines provide a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation (for example, increased scalability and an upgraded CPU class). These virtual machines also feature fast and large local SSD storage (up to 3,600 GiB).

Ddv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD and Standard HDD disk types. To use Premium SSD or Ultra Disk storage, select Ddsv5-series virtual machines. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).

## Ddsv5-series

Ddsv5-series virtual machines run on the 3rd Generation Intel速 Xeon速 Platinum 8370C (Ice Lake) processor reaching an all core turbo clock speed of up to 3.5 GHz.  These virtual machines offer up to 96 vCPU and 384 GiB of RAM as well as fast, local SSD storage up to 3,600 GiB. Ddsv5-series virtual machines provide a better value proposition for most general-purpose workloads compared to the prior generation (for example, increased scalability and an upgraded CPU class).

Ddsv5-series virtual machines support Standard SSD, Standard HDD, and Premium SSD disk types. You can also attach Ultra Disk storage based on its regional availability. Disk storage is billed separately from virtual machines. [See pricing for disks](https://azure.microsoft.com/pricing/details/managed-disks/).
