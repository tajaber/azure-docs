# KeyVaultReference support for Azure-deployed Service Fabric Applications

A common challenge when building cloud applications is figuring out how to securely distribute secrets to your applications and manage them. Service Fabric KeyVaultReference support makes it easy. Once configured, you can reference the URL of the secret that is stored in Key Vault in your application definition and Service Fabric will handle fetching that secret and activating your application with it. When using the "SF-managed" version of the feature, Service Fabric can also monitor your Key Vault and automatically trigger rolling application parameter upgrades as your secrets rotate in the vault.

## Options for delivering secrets to applications in Service Fabric

The classic way of delivering secrets to a Service Fabric application was to declare [Encrypted Parameters](service-fabric-application-secret-management.md). This involved encrypting secrets against an encryption certificate, and passing those encrypted secrets to your application. This method has a few downsides: needing to manage the encryption certificate, exposure of the secrets in the deployment pipeline, and a lack of visibility into the metadata of the secrets attached to a deployed application. Similarly, rotating secrets requires an application deployment. Unless you're running a standalone cluster, we no longer recommend using encrypted parameters.

Another option is the use of [Secret Store References](service-fabric-application-secret-store.md#use-the-secret-in-your-application). This experience allows for central management of your application secrets, better visibility into the metadata of deployed secrets, and allows for central management of the encryption certificate. Some may prefer this style of secret management when running standalone Service Fabric clusters.

The recommendation today is to reduce the reliance on secrets wherever possible by using [Managed Identities for Service Fabric applications](concepts-managed-identity.md). Managed identities can be used to authenticate directly to Azure Storage, Azure SQL, and more. That means there's no need to manage a separate credential when accessing [Azure services that support Azure AD authentication](../active-directory/managed-identities-azure-resources/services-azure-active-directory-support.md).

When it isn't possible to use Managed Identity as a client, we recommend using KeyVaultReferences. You should use KeyVaultReferences rather than using Managed Identity to go directly to Key Vault. KeyVaultReferences help increase the availability of your application because it enforces that secret changes happen during rolling upgrades. It also scales better as secrets are cached and served from within the cluster. If your application uses Encrypted Parameters today, there are only minimal changes needed in your application code to use KeyVaultReferences. Your application can continue to expect to come up with a single secret, and for that secret to be the same for the lifetime of the process.

## Prerequisites

- Managed Identity for Service Fabric Applications

    Service Fabric KeyVaultReference support uses an application's Managed Identity to fetch secrets on behalf of the application. You must deploy your application via ARM and assign it a managed identity. Follow this [document](concepts-managed-identity.md) to enable managed identity for your application.

- Central Secrets Store (CSS).

    Central Secrets Store (CSS) is Service Fabric's encrypted local secrets cache. This feature uses CSS to protect and persist secrets after they're fetched from Key Vault. Enabling this system service is required to use KeyVaultReferences. Follow this [document](service-fabric-application-secret-store.md) to enable and configure CSS.

- Grant application's managed identity access permission to the Key Vault

    Reference this [document](how-to-grant-access-other-resources.md) to see how to grant managed identity access to Key Vault. Also note if you're using system assigned managed identity, the managed identity is created only after application deployment. This can create race conditions where the application tries to access the secret before the identity can be given access to the vault. The system assigned identity's name will be `{cluster name}/{application name}/{service name}`.

## KeyVaultReferences vs. Managed KeyVaultReferences

The basic idea of KeyVaultReferences is rather than setting the value of your application parameter as your secret, you set it to the Key Vault URL, which will then be resolved to the secret value upon activation of your application. In Key Vault, a single secret, for example, `https://my.vault.azure.net/secrets/MySecret/` can have multiple versions, for example, `https://my.vault.azure.net/secrets/MySecret/<oid1>` and `<oid2>`. When you use a KeyVaultReference, the value should be a versioned reference (`https://my.vault.azure.net/secrets/MySecret/<oid1>`). If you rotate that secret in the vault, for example, to `<oid2>`, you should trigger an application upgrade to the new reference. When you use a ManagedKeyVaultReference, the value should be a version-less reference (`https://my.vault.azure.net/secrets/MySecret/`). Service Fabric will resolve the latest instance `<oid1>` and activate the application with that secret. If you rotate the secret in the vault to `<oid2>`, Service Fabric will automatically trigger an application parameter upgrade to move to `<oid2>` on your behalf.

> [!NOTE]
> KeyVaultReference (versioned secrets) support for Service Fabric Applications is Generally Available starting with Service Fabric version 7.2 CU5. It is recommended that you upgrade to this version before using this feature.

> [!NOTE]
> Managed KeyVaultReference (version-less secrets) support for Service Fabric Applications is Generally Available starting with Service Fabric version 9.0.

## Use KeyVaultReferences in your application

KeyVaultReferences can be consumed

- [As an environment variable](#as-an-environment-variable)
- [Mounted as a file into your container](#mounted-as-a-file-into-your-container)
- [As a reference to a container repository password](#as-a-reference-to-a-container-repository-password)

### As an environment variable

```xml
<EnvironmentVariables>
      <EnvironmentVariable Name="MySecret" Type="KeyVaultReference" Value="<KeyVaultURL>"/>
</EnvironmentVariables>
```

```C#
string secret =  Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MySecret");
```

### Mounted as a file into your container

- Add a section to settings.xml

    Define `MySecret` parameter with Type `KeyVaultReference` and Value `<KeyVaultURL>`

    ```xml
    <Section Name="MySecrets">
        <Parameter Name="MySecret" Type="KeyVaultReference" Value="<KeyVaultURL>"/>
    </Section>
    ```

- Reference the new section in ApplicationManifest.xml in `<ConfigPackagePolicies>`

    ```xml
    <ServiceManifestImport>
        <Policies>
        <IdentityBindingPolicy ServiceIdentityRef="MyServiceMI" ApplicationIdentityRef="MyApplicationMI" />
        <ConfigPackagePolicies CodePackageRef="Code">
            <!--Linux container example-->
            <ConfigPackage Name="Config" SectionName="MySecrets" EnvironmentVariableName="SecretPath" MountPoint="/var/secrets"/>
            <!--Windows container example-->
            <!-- <ConfigPackage Name="Config" SectionName="dbsecrets" EnvironmentVariableName="SecretPath" MountPoint="C:\secrets"/> -->
        </ConfigPackagePolicies>
        </Policies>
    </ServiceManifestImport>
    ```

- Consume the secrets from service code

    Each parameter listed under `<Section  Name=MySecrets>` will be a file under the folder pointed to by EnvironmentVariable SecretPath. The below C# code snippet shows how to read MySecret from your application.

    ```C#
    string secretPath = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("SecretPath");
    using (StreamReader sr = new StreamReader(Path.Combine(secretPath, "MySecret"))) 
    {
        string secret =  sr.ReadToEnd();
    }
    ```

    > [!NOTE]
    > MountPoint controls the folder where the files containing secret values will be mounted.

### As a reference to a container repository password

```xml
 <Policies>
      <ContainerHostPolicies CodePackageRef="Code">
        <RepositoryCredentials AccountName="MyACRUser" Type="KeyVaultReference" Password="<KeyVaultURL>"/>
      </ContainerHostPolicies>
```

## Use Managed KeyVaultReferences in your application

First, you must enable secret monitoring by upgrading your cluster definition:

```json
"fabricSettings": [
    {
        "name": "CentralSecretService",     
        "parameters": [
            {
                "name": "EnableSecretMonitoring",
                "value": "true"
            }
        ]
    }
],
```

> [!NOTE]
> The default may become `true` in the future

After the cluster upgrade has finished, your user application can be upgraded. Anywhere a KeyVaultReference can be used, a ManagedKeyVaultReference can also be used, for example,

```xml
    <Section Name="MySecrets">
        <Parameter Name="MySecret" Type="ManagedKeyVaultReference" Value="[MySecretReference]"/>
    </Section>
```

The primary difference in specifying ManagedKeyVaultReferences is that they *can't* be hardcoded in your application type manifest. They must be declared as Application-level parameters, and further they must be overridden in your ARM application definition.

Here's an excerpt from a well-formed manifest

```xml
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>
<ApplicationManifest ApplicationTypeName="MyAppType" ApplicationTypeVersion="1.0.0">
  <Parameters>
    <Parameter Name="MySecretReference" DefaultValue="" />
  </Parameters>
  <ServiceManifestImport>
    <EnvironmentOverrides CodePackageRef="Code">
      <EnvironmentVariable Name="MySecret" Value="[MySecretReference]" Type="ManagedKeyVaultReference" />
    </EnvironmentOverrides>
    <Policies>
      <IdentityBindingPolicy ServiceIdentityRef="MySvcIdentity" ApplicationIdentityRef="MyAppIdentity" />
    </Policies>
  </ServiceManifestImport>
  <Principals>
    <ManagedIdentities>
      <ManagedIdentity Name="MyAppIdentity" />
    </ManagedIdentities>
  </Principals>
</ApplicationManifest>
```

and an excerpt of the application resource definition:

```json
{
    "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/clusters/applications",
    "name": "MyApp",
    "identity": {
        "type" : "userAssigned",
        "userAssignedIdentities": {
            "[variables('userAssignedIdentityResourceId')]": {}
        }
    },
    "properties": {
        "parameters": {
            "MySecretReference": "https://my.vault.azure.net/secrets/MySecret/"
        },
        "managedIdentities": [
            {
            "name" : "MyAppIdentity",
            "principalId" : "<guid>"
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

Both declaring the ManagedKeyVaultReference as an application parameter, as well as overriding that parameter at deployment is needed for Service Fabric to successfully manage the lifecycle of the deployed secret.
