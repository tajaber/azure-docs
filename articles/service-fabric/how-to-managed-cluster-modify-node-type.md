# Service Fabric managed cluster node types

Each node type in a Service Fabric managed cluster is backed by a virtual machine scale set. With managed clusters, you make any required changes through the Service Fabric managed cluster resource provider. All of the underlying resources for the cluster are created and abstracted by the managed cluster provider on your behalf. Having the resource provider manage the resources helps to simplify cluster node type deployment and management, prevent operation errors such as deleting a seed node, and application of best practices such as validating a VM SKU is safe to use.

The rest of this document will cover how to adjust various settings from creating a node type, adjusting node type instance count, enable automatic OS image upgrades, change the OS Image, and configuring placement properties. This document will also focus on using Azure portal or Azure Resource Manager Templates to make changes.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> At this time, Service Fabric Managed Clusters do not support custom OS images.

> [!NOTE]
> You will not be able to modify the node type while a change is in progress. It is recommended to let any requested change complete before doing another.


## Add a node type
You can add a node type to a Service Fabric managed cluster through Portal, an Azure Resource Manager template, or PowerShell. 

### Add with portal
> [!NOTE]
> You can only add secondary node types using Portal

1) Log in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

2) Navigate to your cluster resource Overview page. 
![Sample Overview page][overview]

3) Select `Node types` under the `Settings` section 
![Node Types view][addremove]

4) Click `Add` at the top, fill in the required information, then click Add at the bottom, that's it!

5) Wait for the new node type addition to be completed

### Add with an ARM template

Add another resource type `Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes` with the required values and do a cluster deployment for the setting to take effect.

* The Service Fabric managed cluster resource apiVersion should be **2021-05-01** or later.
* Make sure to set `isPrimary` to `true` if you are intending to replace an existing primary node type.

```json
{
    "apiVersion": "[variables('sfApiVersion')]",
    "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes",
    "name": "[concat(parameters('clusterName'), '/', parameters('nodeType2Name'))]",
    "location": "[resourcegroup().location]",
    "dependsOn": [
        "[concat('Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/', parameters('clusterName'))]"
    ],
    "properties": {
        "isPrimary": false,
        "vmImagePublisher": "[parameters('vmImagePublisher')]",
        "vmImageOffer": "[parameters('vmImageOffer')]",
        "vmImageSku": "[parameters('vmImageSku')]",
        "vmImageVersion": "[parameters('vmImageVersion')]",
        "vmSize": "[parameters('nodeType2VmSize')]",
        "vmInstanceCount": "[parameters('nodeType2VmInstanceCount')]",
        "dataDiskSizeGB": "[parameters('nodeType2DataDiskSizeGB')]",
        "dataDiskType": "[parameters('nodeType2managedDataDiskType')]"
    }
}
```

For an example two node type configuration, see our [sample two node type ARM Template](https://github.com/Azure-Samples/service-fabric-cluster-templates/blob/master/SF-Managed-Standard-SKU-2-NT)

### Add with PowerShell

To create a new node type, you'll need to define these properties:
* **Resource Group**: Resource group the cluster is in
* **Cluster Name**: Name of the managed cluster
* **Node Type Name**: Name that is unique from any existing node types in the cluster.
* **Instance Count**: Initial number of nodes of the new node type.
* **VM Size**: VM SKU for the nodes. If not specified, the default value *Standard_D2* is used.

> [!NOTE]
> If adding a primary node type, the `-Primary` property must be used.

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$clusterName = "mysfcluster"
$nodeTypeName = "nt2"
$vmSize = "Standard_D2_v2"

New-AzServiceFabricManagedNodeType -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -ClusterName $clusterName -Name $nodeTypeName -InstanceCount 3 -vmSize $vmSize
```


## Remove a node type
You can remove a Service Fabric managed cluster node type using Portal or PowerShell.

> [!NOTE]
> To remove a primary node type from a Service Fabric managed cluster, you must use PowerShell and there must be more than one primary node type available.

### Remove with portal
1) Log in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

2) Navigate to your cluster resource Overview page. 
![Sample Overview page][overview]

3) Select `Node types` under the `Settings` section 
![Node Types view][addremove]

4) Select the `Node Type` you want to remove and click `Delete` at the top.

### Remove with PowerShell
> [!NOTE]
> If removing a primary node type for scenarios such as upgrading the SKU it will take multiple hours and progress can be monitored by using SFX. Seed nodes will migrate one node per upgrade domain(UD) walk at a time.

To remove a node type, you'll need to define these properties:
* **Resource Group**: Resource group the cluster is in
* **Cluster Name**: Name of the managed cluster
* **Node Type Name**: Name that is unique from any existing node types in the cluster.

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$clusterName = "myCluster"
$nodeTypeName = "nt2"

Remove-AzServiceFabricManagedNodeType -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -ClusterName $clusterName  -Name $nodeTypeName
```


## Scale a node type 
You can scale a Service Fabric managed cluster node type with portal, ARM template, or PowerShell. You can also [configure autoscale for a secondary node type](how-to-managed-cluster-autoscale.md) if you want a fully automated solution.

> [!NOTE]
> * A primary node type can't be set to auto-scale and you can only set it to manual scale. 
> * For the Primary node type, you will not be able to go below 3 nodes for a Basic SKU cluster, and 5 nodes for a Standard SKU cluster.

### Scale using portal

In this walkthrough, you will learn how to modify the node count for a node type using portal.

1) Log in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

2) Navigate to your cluster resource Overview page. 
![Sample Overview page][overview]

3) Select `Node Types` under the `Settings` section 

4) Select the `Node type name` you want to modify

5) Review and update node type properties if needed.

![Sample showing a node count increase][adjust-node-count]

6) Select `Manage node type scaling` to configure the scaling settings and choose between custom autoscale and manual scale options. Autoscale is a built-in feature that helps applications perform their best when demand changes. You can choose to scale your resource manually to a specific instance count, or via a custom Autoscale policy that scales based on metric(s) thresholds, or schedule instance count which scales during designated time windows. [Learn more about Azure Autoscale](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/autoscale-get-started?WT.mc_id=Portal-Microsoft_Azure_Monitoring) or [view the how-to video](https://www.microsoft.com/videoplayer/embed/RE4u7ts).

   * **Custom autoscale**: Select the appropriate `scale mode` to define the custom Autoscale policy - `Scale to a specific instance count`or `Scale based on a metric`. The latter is based on metric trigger rules, for example, increase instance count by 1 when CPU Percentage is above 70%. Once you define the policy, select `Save` at the top.

       ![Sample showing auto scaling setting][auto-scale-setting]
   
   * **Manual scale**: Adjust the `Node count` to the new value you want and select `Save` at the top.  In this screenshot, the value was `3` and adjusted to                 `5`.

       ![Sample showing manual scaling setting][manual-scale-setting]

   Select `Apply` at the bottom to configure these saved settings on the node type.

7) The `Provisioning state` will now show a status of `Updating` until complete. When complete, it will show `Succeeded` again.
![Sample showing a node type updating][node-type-updating]


### Scale a node type with a template

To adjust the node count for a node type using an ARM Template, adjust the `vmInstanceCount` property with the new value and do a cluster deployment for the setting to take effect. The cluster will begin upgrading automatically you will see the additional nodes when complete.

* The Service Fabric managed cluster resource apiVersion should be **2021-05-01** or later.

> [!NOTE]
> The managed cluster provider will block scale adjustments and return an error if the scaling request violates required minimums.

```json
     {
            "apiVersion": "[variables('sfApiVersion')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes",
            "name": "[concat(parameters('clusterName'), '/', parameters('nodeTypeName'))]",
            "location": "[resourcegroup().location]",
            "properties": {
                ...
                "vmInstanceCount": "[parameters('nodeTypeVmInstanceCount')]",
                ...
            }
        }
}
```

### Scale a node type with PowerShell
Change the instance count to increase or decrease the number of nodes on the node type that you would like to scale. You can find node type names in the Azure Resource Manager template (ARM template) from your cluster deployment, or in the Service Fabric Explorer.  

```powershell
$resourceGroup = "myResourceGroup"
$clusterName = "mysfcluster"
$nodeTypeName = "FE"
$instanceCount = "7"

Set-AzServiceFabricManagedNodeType -ResourceGroupName $resourceGroup -ClusterName $clusterName -name $nodeTypeName -InstanceCount $instanceCount -Verbose
```

The cluster will begin upgrading automatically you will see the additional nodes when complete.


## Enable automatic OS image upgrades

You can choose to enable automatic OS image upgrades to the virtual machines running your managed cluster nodes. Although the virtual machine scale set resources are managed on your behalf with Service Fabric managed clusters, it's your choice to enable automatic OS image upgrades for your cluster nodes. As with [classic Service Fabric](service-fabric-best-practices-infrastructure-as-code.md#virtual-machine-os-automatic-upgrade-configuration) clusters, managed cluster nodes are not upgraded by default, in order to prevent unintended disruptions to your cluster.

To enable automatic OS upgrades:

* Use apiVersion `2021-05-01` or later version of *Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters* and *Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes* resources
* Set the cluster's property `enableAutoOSUpgrade` to *true*
* Set the cluster nodeTypes' resource property `vmImageVersion` to *latest*

For example:

```json
    {
      "apiVersion": "[variables('sfApiVersion')]",
      "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters",
      ...
      "properties": {
        ...
        "enableAutoOSUpgrade": true
      },
    },
    {
      "apiVersion": "[variables('sfApiVersion')]",
      "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes",
       ...
      "properties": {
        ...
        "vmImageVersion": "latest",
        ...
      }
    }
}

```

Once enabled, Service Fabric will begin querying and tracking OS image versions in the managed cluster. If a new OS version is available, the cluster node types (virtual machine scale sets) will be upgraded, one at a time. Service Fabric runtime upgrades are performed only after confirming no cluster node OS image upgrades are in progress.

If an upgrade fails, Service Fabric will retry after 24 hours, for a maximum of three retries. Similar to classic (unmanaged) Service Fabric upgrades, unhealthy apps or nodes may block the OS image upgrade.

For more on image upgrades, see [Automatic OS image upgrades with Azure virtual machine scale sets](../virtual-machine-scale-sets/virtual-machine-scale-sets-automatic-upgrade.md).

## Modify the OS SKU for a node type
Service Fabric managed clusters enables you to modify the OS SKU for a node type in place. This is helpful for scenarios such as migrating from Windows 2019 to Windows 2022 or if you want to switch to a Server (Core) SKU vs Server with Desktop Experience SKU.

### Modify OS SKU with portal

In this walkthrough, you will learn how to modify the OS image for a node type using portal.

1) Log in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

2) Navigate to your cluster resource Overview page. 
![Sample Overview page][overview]

3) Select `Node Types` under the `Settings` section 

4) Select the `Node type name` you want to modify

5) Adjust the `OS Image` to the new value you want and select `Apply` at the bottom. 
![Sample showing changing the OS image][change-os-image]

6) The `Provisioning state` will now show a status of `Updating` and will proceed one upgrade domain at a time. When complete, it will show `Succeeded` again.
![Sample showing a node type updating][node-type-updating]


### Modify OS SKU with a template

To modify the OS image used for a node type using an ARM Template, adjust the `vmImageSku` property with the new value and do a cluster deployment for the setting to take effect. The managed cluster provider will reimage each instance by upgrade domain.

* The Service Fabric managed cluster resource apiVersion should be **2021-05-01** or later.

```json
     {
            "apiVersion": "[variables('sfApiVersion')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes",
            "name": "[concat(parameters('clusterName'), '/', parameters('nodeTypeName'))]",
            "location": "[resourcegroup().location]",
            "properties": {
                ...
                "vmImagePublisher": "[parameters('vmImagePublisher')]",
                "vmImageOffer": "[parameters('vmImageOffer')]",
                "vmImageSku": "[parameters('vmImageSku')]",
                "vmImageVersion": "[parameters('vmImageVersion')]",
                ...
            }
        }
}
```

## Configure placement properties for a node type
[Placement properties](service-fabric-cluster-resource-manager-cluster-description.md#node-properties-and-placement-constraints) are used to ensure that certain workloads run only on certain node types in the cluster. Service Fabric managed clusters support configuring these properties via portal, ARM template, or PowerShell.

### Configure placement properties with portal

In this walkthrough, you will learn how to modify a placement property for a node type using portal.

1) Log in to [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com/)

2) Navigate to your cluster resource Overview page. 
![Sample Overview page][overview]

3) Select `Node Types` under the `Settings` section 

4) Select the `Node type name` you want to modify

5) In the `Placement properties` section add the name and value you want and select `Apply` at the bottom. In this screenshot, the `Name` `SSD_Premium` was used with `Value` of `true`.
![Sample showing adding a placement property][nodetype-placement-property]

6) The `Provisioning state` will now show a status of `Updating` until complete. When complete, it will show `Succeeded` again.
![Sample showing a node type updating][node-type-updating]


### Configure placement properties with a template

To adjust the placement properties for a node type using an ARM Template, adjust the `placementProperties` property with the new value(s) and do a cluster deployment for the setting to take effect. The below sample shows three values being set for a node type.

* The Service Fabric managed cluster resource apiVersion should be **2021-05-01** or later.

```json
     {
            "apiVersion": "[variables('sfApiVersion')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes",
            "name": "[concat(parameters('clusterName'), '/', parameters('nodeTypeName'))]",
            "location": "[resourcegroup().location]",
            "properties": {
                "placementProperties": {
                    "PremiumSSD": "true",
                    "NodeColor": "green",
                    "SomeProperty": "5"
            }
        }
}
```

### Configure placement properties with PowerShell

The following example will update and overwrite any existing placement properties for a given node type.

```PowerShell
$rgName = "testRG"
$clusterName = "testCluster"
$NodeTypeName = "nt1"
Set-AzServiceFabricManagedNodeType -ResourceGroupName $rgName -ClusterName $clusterName -name $NodeTypeName -PlacementProperty @{NodeColor="Red";SomeProperty="6";} -Verbose
```

## Modify the VM SKU for a node type

To modify the VM SKU size used for a node type using an ARM Template, adjust the `vmSize` property with the new value and do a cluster deployment for the setting to take effect. The managed cluster provider will reimage each instance by upgrade domain.  For a list of SKU options, please refer to the [VM sizes - Azure Virtual Machines | Microsoft Learn](../virtual-machines/sizes.md).  

```json
     {
            "apiVersion": "[variables('sfApiVersion')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes",
            "name": "[concat(parameters('clusterName'), '/', parameters('nodeTypeName'))]",
            "location": "[resourcegroup().location]",
            "properties": {
                ...
                "vmSize": "[parameters('vmImageVersion')]",
                ...
            }
        }
}
```
## Configure multiple managed disks
Service Fabric managed clusters by default configure one managed disk. By configuring the following optional property and values, you can add more managed disks to node types within a cluster. You are able to specify the drive letter, disk type, and size per disk.

Configure more managed disks by declaring `additionalDataDisks` property and required parameters in your Resource Manager template as follows:

**Feature Requirements**
* Lun must be unique per disk and can't use reserved lun 0
* Disk letter cannot use reserved letters C or D and cannot be modified once created. S will be used as default if not specified.
* Must specify a [supported disk type](how-to-managed-cluster-managed-disk.md)
* The Service Fabric managed cluster resource apiVersion should be **2022-01-01** or later.

```json
     {
            "apiVersion": "[variables('sfApiVersion')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes",
            "name": "[concat(parameters('clusterName'), '/', parameters('nodeTypeName'))]",
            "location": "[resourcegroup().location]",
            "properties": {
                "additionalDataDisks": {
                    "lun": "1",
                    "diskSizeGB": "50",
                    "diskType": "Standard_LRS",
                    "diskLetter": "S" 
            }
        }
     }
```

See [full list of parameters available](/azure/templates/microsoft.servicefabric/2021-11-01-preview/managedclusters)

## Configure the Service Fabric data disk drive letter
Service Fabric managed clusters by default configure a Service Fabric data disk and automatically configure the drive letter on all nodes of a node type. By configuring this optional property and value, you can specify and retrieve the Service Fabric data disk letter if you have specific requirements for drive letter mapping.

**Feature Requirements**
* Disk letter cannot use reserved letters C or D and cannot be modified once created. S will be used as default if not specified.
* The Service Fabric managed cluster resource apiVersion should be **2022-01-01** or later.

```json
     {
            "apiVersion": "[variables('sfApiVersion')]",
            "type": "Microsoft.ServiceFabric/managedclusters/nodetypes",
            "name": "[concat(parameters('clusterName'), '/', parameters('nodeTypeName'))]",
            "location": "[resourcegroup().location]",
            "properties": {
                "dataDiskLetter": "S"      
            }
        }
     }
```
