# Usage scenarios of Azure Network Watcher traffic analytics

Some of the insights you might want to gain after Traffic Analytics is fully configured, are as follows:

## Find traffic hotspots

**Look for**

- Which hosts, subnets, virtual networks, and virtual machine scale set are sending or receiving the most traffic, traversing maximum malicious traffic and blocking significant flows?
    - Check comparative chart for hosts, subnet, virtual network, and virtual machine scale set. Understanding, which hosts, subnets, virtual networks and virtual machine scale set are sending or receiving the most traffic can help you identify the hosts that are processing the most traffic, and whether the traffic distribution is done properly.
    - You can evaluate if the volume of traffic is appropriate for a host. Is the volume of traffic normal behavior, or does it merit further investigation?
- How much inbound/outbound traffic is there?
    -   Is the host expected to receive more inbound traffic than outbound, or vice-versa?
- Statistics of blocked traffic.
    - Why is a host blocking a significant volume of benign traffic? This behavior requires further investigation and probably optimization of configuration
- Statistics of malicious allowed/blocked traffic
  - Why is a host receiving malicious traffic and why are flows from malicious sources allowed? This behavior requires further investigation and probably optimization of configuration.

    Select **See all** under **IP** as shown in the following image:

    The following image shows time trending for the top five talking hosts and the flow-related details (allowed â€“ inbound/outbound and denied - inbound/outbound flows) for a host:

	Select **See more** under **Details of top 5 talking IPs'** as shown in the following image to get insights about all the hosts:

    ![Screenshot of top five most-talking host trends.](media/traffic-analytics/top-five-most-talking-host-trend.png)
	

**Look for**

- Which are the most conversing host pairs?
    - Expected behavior like front-end or back-end communication or irregular behavior, like back-end internet traffic.
- Statistics of allowed/blocked traffic
    - Why a host is allowing or blocking significant traffic volume
- Most frequently used application protocol among most conversing host pairs:
    - Are these applications allowed on this network?
    - Are the applications configured properly? Are they using the appropriate protocol for communication? Select **See all** under **Frequent conversation**, as show in the following image:

        ![Screenshot of dashboard showcasing most frequent conversations.](./media/traffic-analytics/dashboard-showcasing-most-frequent-conversation.png)

- The following image shows time trending for the top five conversations and the flow-related details such as allowed and denied inbound and outbound flows for a conversation pair:

    ![Screenshot of top five chatty conversation details and trends.](./media/traffic-analytics/top-five-chatty-conversation-details-and-trend.png)

**Look for**

- Which application protocol is most used in your environment, and which conversing host pairs are using the application protocol the most?
    - Are these applications allowed on this network?
    - Are the applications configured properly? Are they using the appropriate protocol for communication? Expected behavior is common ports such as 80 and 443. For standard communication, if any unusual ports are displayed, they might require a configuration change. Select **See all** under **Application port**, in the following image:

**Look for**

- Capacity utilization trends of a VPN gateway in your environment.
    - Each VPN SKU allows a certain amount of bandwidth. Are the VPN gateways underutilized?
    - Are your gateways reaching capacity? Should you upgrade to the next higher SKU?
- Which are the most conversing hosts, via which VPN gateway, over which port?
    - Is this pattern normal? Select **See all** under **VPN gateway**, as shown in the following image:

        ![Screenshot of dashboard showcasing top active V P N connections.](./media/traffic-analytics/dashboard-showcasing-top-active-vpn-connections.png)

## Visualize traffic distribution by geography

**Look for**

- Traffic distribution per data center such as top sources of traffic to a datacenter, top rogue networks conversing with the data center, and top conversing application protocols.
  - If you observe more load on a data center, you can plan for efficient traffic distribution.
  - If rogue networks are conversing in the data center, then correct NSG rules to block them.

    Select **View map** under **Your environment**, as shown in the following image:

    ![Screenshot of dashboard showcasing traffic distribution.](./media/traffic-analytics/dashboard-showcasing-traffic-distribution.png)

## Visualize traffic distribution by virtual networks

**Look for**

- You can filter the Virtual Network Topology based on subscriptions, workspaces, resource groups and time interval. Extra filters that help you understand the flow are:
  Flow Type (InterVNet, IntraVNET, and so on), Flow Direction (Inbound, Outbound), Flow Status (Allowed, Blocked), VNETs (Targeted and Connected), Connection Type (Peering or Gateway - P2S and S2S), and NSG. Use these filters to focus on VNets that you want to examine in detail.
- You can zoom-in and zoom-out while viewing Virtual Network Topology using mouse scroll wheel. Left-click and moving the mouse lets you drag the topology in desired direction. You can also use keyboard shortcuts to achieve these actions: A (to drag left), D (to drag right), W (to drag up), S (to drag down), + (to zoom in), - (to zoom out), R (to zoom reset).
- The Virtual Network Topology shows the traffic distribution to a virtual network  to flows (Allowed/Blocked/Inbound/Outbound/Benign/Malicious), application protocol, and network security groups, for example:
