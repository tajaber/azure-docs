## Hive Partition Discovery and Repair

Hive automatically discovers and synchronizes the metadata of the partition in Hive Metastore. 
The `discover.partitions` table property enables and disables synchronization of the file system with partitions. In external partitioned tables, this property is enabled (true) by default. 
When Hive Metastore Service (HMS) is started in remote service mode, a background thread `(PartitionManagementTask)` gets scheduled periodically every 300 s (configurable via `metastore.partition.management.task.frequency config`) that looks for tables with `discover.partitions` table property set to true and performs `msck` repair in sync mode.

If the table is a transactional table, then Exclusive Lock is obtained for that table before performing `msck repair`. With this table property, `MSCK REPAIR TABLE table_name SYNC PARTITIONS` is no longer required to be run manually. 
Assuming you have an external table created using a version of Hive that doesn't support partition discovery, enable partition discovery for the table.

```ALTER TABLE exttbl SET TBLPROPERTIES ('discover.partitions' = 'true');```

Set synchronization of partitions to occur every 10 minutes expressed in seconds: In Ambari > Hive > Configs, `set metastore.partition.management.task.frequency` to 3600 or more.

Hive drops the metadata and corresponding data in any partition created after the retention period. You express the retention time using a numeral and the following character or characters.
Hive drops the metadata and corresponding data in any partition created after the retention period. You express the retention time using a numeral and the following  character(s).

```
ms (milliseconds)
s (seconds)
m (minutes)
d (days)
```

To configure a partition retention period for one week.

```
ALTER TABLE employees SET TBLPROPERTIES ('partition.retention.period'='7d');
```

The partition metadata and the actual data for employees in Hive is automatically dropped after a week.

## Hive 3

### Performance optimizations available under Hive 3

OLAP Vectorization Dynamic Semijoin reduction Parquet support for vectorization with LLAP Automatic query cache.

**New SQL features**

Materialized Views Surrogate Keys Constraints Metastore CachedStore.

**OLAP Vectorization**

Vectorization allows Hive to process a batch of rows together instead of processing one row at a time. Each batch is usually an array of primitive types. Operations are performed on the entire column vector, which improves the instruction pipelines and cache usage.
Vectorized execution of PTF, roll up and grouping sets.

**Dynamic `Semijoin` reduction**

Dramatically improves performance for selective joins.
It builds a bloom filter from one side of join and filters rows from other side.
Skips scan and further evaluation of rows that wouldn't qualify the join.

**Parquet support for vectorization with LLAP**

Vectorized query execution is a feature that greatly reduces the CPU usage for typical query operations such as 

* scans
* filters
* aggregate
* joins

Vectorization is also implemented for the ORC format. Spark also uses Whole Stage Codegen and this vectorization (for Parquet) since Spark 2.0.
Added timestamp column for Parquet vectorization and format under LLAP.

> [!WARNING]
> Parquet writes are slow when conversion to zoned times from timestamp. For more information, see [**here**](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/HIVE-24693).


### Automatic query cache
1.	With `hive.query.results.cache.enabled=true`, every query that runs in Hive 3 stores its result in a cache.
1.	If the input table changes, Hive evicts invalid data from the cache. For example, if you perform aggregation and the base table changes, queries you run most frequently stay in cache, but stale queries are evicted.
1.	The query result cache works with managed tables only because Hive can't track changes to an external table.
1.	If you join external and managed tables, Hive falls back to executing the full query. The query result cache works with ACID tables. If you update an ACID table, Hive reruns the query automatically.
1.	You can enable and disable the query result cache from command line. You might want to do so to debug a query.
1.	Disable the query result cache by setting the following parameter to false:  `hive.query.results.cache.enabled=false`
1.	Hive stores the query result cache in `/tmp/hive/__resultcache__/`. By default, Hive allocates 2 GB for the query result cache. You can change this setting by configuring the following parameter in bytes: `hive.query.results.cache.max.size`
1.	Changes to query processing: During query compilation, check the results cache to see if it already has the query results. If there's a cache hit, then the query plan will be set to a `FetchTask` that will read from the cached location.

During query execution:

Parquet `DataWriteableWriter` relies on `NanoTimeUtils` to convert a timestamp object into a binary value. This query calls `toString()` on the timestamp object, and then parses the String.

1. If the results cache can be used for this query
    1. The query will be the `FetchTask` reading from the cached results directory. 
    1. No cluster tasks will be required.
1. If the results cache can't be used, run the cluster tasks as normal
    1. Check if the query results that have been computed are eligible to add to the results cache.
    1. If results can be cached, the temporary results generated for the query will be saved to the results cache. Steps may need to be done here to ensure the query results directory isn't deleted by query clean-up.

## SQL features

**Materialized Views**

The initial implementation introduced in Apache Hive 3.0.0 focuses on introducing materialized views and automatic query rewriting based on those materializations in the project. Materialized views can be stored natively in Hive or in other custom storage handlers (ORC), and they can seamlessly exploit exciting new Hive features such as LLAP acceleration.

More information, see [Hive - Materialized Views - Microsoft Tech Community](https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/analytics-on-azure-blog/hive-materialized-views/ba-p/2502785)

## Surrogate Keys

Use the built-in `SURROGATE_KEY` user-defined function (UDF) to automatically generate numerical Ids for rows as you enter data into a table. The generated surrogate keys can replace wide, multiple composite keys.

Hive supports the surrogate keys on ACID tables only. The table you want to join using surrogate keys can't have column types that need casting. These data types must be primitives, such as INT or `STRING`.

Joins using the generated keys are faster than joins using strings. Using generated keys doesn't force data into a single node by a row number. You can generate keys as abstractions of natural keys. Surrogate keys have an advantage over UUIDs, which are slower and probabilistic.

The `SURROGATE_KEY UDF` generates a unique ID for every row that you insert into a table.
It generates keys based on the execution environment in a distributed system, which includes many factors, such as 

1. Internal data structures
2. State of a table
3. Last transaction ID. 

Surrogate key generation doesn't require any coordination between compute tasks. The UDF takes no arguments, or two arguments are

1. Write ID bits
1. Task ID bits

### Constraints

SQL constraints to enforce data integrity and improve performance. The optimizer uses the constraint information to make smart decisions. Constraints can make data predictable and easy to locate.

|Constraints|Description|
|---|---|
|Check|Limits the range of values you can place in a column.|
|PRIMARY KEY|Identifies each row in a table using a unique identifier.|
|FOREIGN KEY|Identifies a row in another table using a unique identifier.|
|UNIQUE KEY|Checks that values stored in a column are different.|
|NOT NULL|Ensures that a column can't be set to NULL.|
|ENABLE|Ensures that all incoming data conforms to the constraint.|
|DISABLE|Doesn't ensure that all incoming data conforms to the constraint.|
|VALIDATEC|hecks that all existing data in the table conforms to the constraint.|
|NOVALIDATE|Doesn't check that all existing data in the table conforms to the constraint
|ENFORCED|Maps to ENABLE NOVALIDATE.|
|NOT ENFORCED|Maps to DISABLE NOVALIDATE.|
|RELY|Specifies abiding by a constraint; used by the optimizer to apply further optimizations.|
|NORELY|Specifies not abiding by a constraint.|

### Metastore `CachedStore`

Hive metastore operation takes much time and thus slow down Hive compilation. In some extreme case, it takes much longer than the actual query run time. Especially, we find the latency of cloud db is high and 90% of total query runtime is waiting for metastore SQL database operations. Based on this observation, the metastore operation performance will be greatly enhanced, if we have a memory structure which cache the database query result.
