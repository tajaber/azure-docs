# Set Variable Activity in Azure Data Factory and Azure Synapse Analytics
[!INCLUDE[appliesto-adf-asa-md](includes/appliesto-adf-asa-md.md)]

Use the Set Variable activity to set the value of an existing variable of type String, Bool, or Array defined in a Data Factory or Synapse pipeline or use the Set Variable activity to set a pipeline return value (preview).

## Create a Set Variable activity with UI

To use a Set Variable activity in a pipeline, complete the following steps:

1. Select the background of the pipeline canvas and use the Variables tab to add a variable:

:::image type="content" source="media/control-flow-activities-common/add-pipeline-array-variable.png" alt-text="Screenshot of an empty pipeline canvas with the Variables tab selected with an array type variable named TestVariable.":::

2. Search for _Set Variable_ in the pipeline Activities pane, and drag a Set Variable activity to the pipeline canvas.

3. Select the Set Variable activity on the canvas if it isn't already selected, and then select the **Settings** tab to edit its details.

4. Select **Pipeline variable** for your **Variable type**.

5. Select the variable for the Name property.

6. Enter an expression to set the value for the variables. This expression can be a literal string expression, or any combination of dynamic [expressions, functions](control-flow-expression-language-functions.md), [system variables](control-flow-system-variables.md), or [outputs from other activities](how-to-expression-language-functions.md#examples-of-using-parameters-in-expressions).

## Setting a pipeline return value with UI

We have expanded Set Variable activity to include a special system variable, named _Pipeline Return Value_. This allows communication from the child pipeline to the calling pipeline, in the following scenario. 

You don't need to define the variable, before using it. For more information, see [Pipeline Return Value](tutorial-pipeline-return-value.md)

## Type properties

Property | Description | Required
-------- | ----------- | --------
name | Name of the activity in pipeline | yes
description | Text describing what the activity does | no
type | Must be set to **SetVariable** | yes
variableName | Name of the variable that is set by this activity | yes
value | String literal or expression object value that the variable is assigned to | yes


## Incrementing a variable

A common scenario involving variable is to use a variable as an iterator within an **Until** or **ForEach** activity. In a **Set variable** activity, you can't reference the variable being set in the `value` field. To work around this limitation, set a temporary variable and then create a second **Set variable** activity. The second **Set variable** activity sets the value of the iterator to the temporary variable. 

Below is an example of this pattern:

                        "value": "@string(add(int(variables('i')), 1))",
                        "type": "Expression"
                    }
                }
            }
        ],
        "variables": {
            "i": {
                "type": "String",
                "defaultValue": "0"
            },
            "j": {
                "type": "String",
                "defaultValue": "0"
            }
        },
        "annotations": []
    }
}
```

Variables are currently scoped at the pipeline level. This means that they're not thread safe and can cause unexpected and undesired behavior if they're accessed from within a parallel iteration activity such as a ForEach loop, especially when the value is also being modified within that foreach activity.
