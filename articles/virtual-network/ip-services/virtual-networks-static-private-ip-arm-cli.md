# Create a virtual machine with a static private IP address using the Azure CLI

A virtual machine (VM) is automatically assigned a private IP address from a range that you specify. This range is based on the subnet in which the VM is deployed. The VM keeps the address until the VM is deleted. Azure dynamically assigns the next available private IP address from the subnet you create a VM in. Assign a static IP address to the VM if you want a specific IP address in the subnet.

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- This tutorial requires version 2.0.28 or later of the Azure CLI. If using Azure Cloud Shell, the latest version is already installed.

## Create a resource group

An Azure resource group is a logical container into which Azure resources are deployed and managed.

Create a resource group with [az group create](/cli/azure/group#az-group-create) named **myResourceGroup** in the **eastus2** location.

```azurecli-interactive
  az group create \
    --name myResourceGroup \
    --location eastus2
```

## Create a virtual machine

Create a virtual machine with [az vm create](/cli/azure/vm#az-vm-create). 

The following command creates a Windows Server virtual machine. When prompted, provide a username and password to be used as the credentials for the virtual machine:

```azurecli-interactive
  az vm create \
    --name myVM \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --public-ip-address myPublicIP \
    --public-ip-sku Standard \
    --image MicrosoftWindowsServer:WindowsServer:2019-Datacenter:latest \
    --admin-username azureuser
```

## Change private IP address to static

In this section, you'll change the private IP address from **dynamic** to **static** for the virtual machine you created previously. 

Use [az network nic ip-config update](/cli/azure/network/nic/ip-config#az-network-nic-ip-config-update) to update the network interface configuration.

The following command changes the private IP address of the virtual machine to static:

```azurecli-interactive
  az network nic ip-config update \
    --name ipconfigmyVM \
    --resource-group myResourceGroup \
    --nic-name myVMVMNic \
    --private-ip-address 10.0.0.4
```

> [!WARNING]
> From within the operating system of a VM, you shouldn't statically assign the *private* IP that's assigned to the Azure VM. Only do static assignment of a private IP when it's necessary, such as when [assigning many IP addresses to VMs](virtual-network-multiple-ip-addresses-portal.md). 
>
>If you manually set the private IP address within the operating system, make sure it matches the private IP address assigned to the Azure [network interface](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md#change-ip-address-settings). Otherwise, you can lose connectivity to the VM. Learn more about [private IP address](virtual-network-network-interface-addresses.md#private) settings.

## Clean up resources

When no longer needed, you can use [az group delete](/cli/azure/group#az-group-delete) to remove the resource group and all of the resources it contains:

```azurecli-interactive
  az group delete --name myResourceGroup --yes
```
