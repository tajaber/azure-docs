# Monitoring Public IP addresses

When you have critical applications and business processes relying on Azure resources, you want to monitor those resources for their availability, performance, and operation. 

This article describes the monitoring data generated by Public IP Address. Public IP Addresses use [Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/overview.md). If you are unfamiliar with the features of Azure Monitor common to all Azure services that use it, read [Monitoring Azure resources with Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md).

## *Public IP Addresses* insights

Some services in Azure have a special focused pre-built monitoring dashboard in the Azure portal that provides a starting point for monitoring your service. These special dashboards are called "insights".

Public IP Address insights provides:

* Traffic data

* DDoS information

## Monitoring data 

Public IP Addresses collect the same kinds of monitoring data as other Azure resources that are described in [Monitoring data from Azure resources](../../azure-monitor/essentials/monitor-azure-resource.md#monitoring-data-from-azure-resources). 

See [Monitoring *Public IP Addresses* data reference](monitor-public-ip-reference.md) for detailed information on the metrics and logs metrics created by Public IP Addresses.

## Collection and routing

Platform metrics and the Activity log are collected and stored automatically, but can be routed to other locations by using a diagnostic setting.  

Resource Logs are not collected and stored until you create a diagnostic setting and route them to one or more locations.

For general guidance, see [Create diagnostic setting to collect platform logs and metrics in Azure](/azure/azure-monitor/platform/diagnostic-settings) for the process for creating a diagnostic setting using the Azure portal, CLI, or PowerShell. When you create a diagnostic setting, you specify which categories of logs to collect. The categories for *Public IP Addresses* are listed in [Monitoring *Public IP Addresses* data reference](monitor-public-ip-reference.md).

## Creating a diagnostic setting

You can create a diagnostic setting by using the Azure portal, PowerShell, or the Azure CLI.

### Portal

1. Sign-in to the [Azure Portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. In the search box at the top of the portal, enter **Public IP addresses**. Select **Public IP addresses** in the search results.

3. Select your the public IP address that you want to enable the setting for. For this example, **myPublicIP** is used.

4. In the **Monitoring** section of your public IP address, select **Diagnostic settings**.

5. Select **+Add diagnostic setting**.

6. Enter or select the following information in **Diagnostic setting**.

    | Setting | Value |
    | ------- | ----- |
    | Diagnostic setting name | Enter a name for the diagnostic setting. |
    | **Logs** |   |
    | Categories | Select **DDoSProtectionNotifications**, **DDoSMitigationFlowLogs**, and **DDoSMitigationReports**. |
    | **Metrics** |   |
    | Select **AllMetrics**. |

7. Select the **Destination details**. Some of the destination options are:

    * **Send to Log Analytics workspace**
        
        * Select the **Subscription** and **Log Analytics workspace**.

    * **Archive to a storage account**

        * Select the **Subscription** and **Storage account**.

    * **Stream to an event hub**

        * Select the **Subscription**, **Event hub namespace**, **Event hub name (optional)**, and **Event hub policy name**.

    * **Send to a partner solution**
        
        * Select the **Subscription** and **Destination**.

8. Select **Save**.

### PowerShell

    Name = 'myPublicIP'
}
$ip = Get-AzPublicIPAddress @ippara
    
## Place the workspace in a variable. ##
$wspara = @{
    ResourceGroupName = 'myResourceGroup'
    Name = 'myLogAnalyticsWorkspace'
}
$ws = Get-AzOperationalInsightsWorkspace @wspara
    
## Enable the diagnostic setting. ##

```

The metrics and logs you can collect are discussed in the following sections.

## Analyzing metrics

You can analyze metrics for *Public IP Addresses* with metrics from other Azure services using metrics explorer by opening **Metrics** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Getting started with Azure Metrics Explorer](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-getting-started.md) for details on using this tool. 

For a list of the platform metrics collected for Public IP Address, see [Monitoring *Public IP Addresses* data reference](monitor-public-ip-reference.md#metrics) .

For reference, you can see a list of [all resource metrics supported in Azure Monitor](../../azure-monitor/essentials/metrics-supported.md).

## Analyzing logs

Data in Azure Monitor Logs is stored in tables where each table has its own set of unique properties.  

All resource logs in Azure Monitor have the same fields followed by service-specific fields. The common schema is outlined in [Azure Monitor resource log schema](../../azure-monitor/essentials/resource-logs-schema.md).

The [Activity log](../../azure-monitor/essentials/activity-log.md) is a type of platform log in Azure that provides insight into subscription-level events. You can view it independently or route it to Azure Monitor Logs, where you can do much more complex queries using Log Analytics.  

For a list of the types of resource logs collected for Public IP addresses, see [Monitoring *Public IP Addresses* data reference](monitor-public-ip-reference.md#resource-logs).

For a list of the tables used by Azure Monitor Logs and queryable by Log Analytics, see [Monitoring *Public IP Addresses* data reference](monitor-public-ip-reference.md#azure-monitor-logs-tables).  

### Sample Kusto queries

> [!IMPORTANT]
> When you select **Logs** from the Public IP menu, Log Analytics is opened with the query scope set to the current Public IP address. This means that log queries will only include data from that resource. If you want to run a query that includes data from other resources or data from other Azure services, select **Logs** from the **Azure Monitor** menu. See [Log query scope and time range in Azure Monitor Log Analytics](../../azure-monitor/logs/scope.md) for details.

For a list of common queries for Public IP addresses, see the [Log Analytics queries interface](../../azure-monitor/logs/queries.md). 

The following is an example of the built in queries for Public IP addresses that are found within the Long Analytics queries interface in the Azure portal.

## Alerts

Azure Monitor alerts proactively notify you when important conditions are found in your monitoring data. They allow you to identify and address issues in your system before your customers notice them. You can set alerts on [metrics](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-metric-overview), [logs](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/alerts-unified-log), and the [activity log](/azure/azure-monitor/alerts/activity-log-alerts). Different types of alerts have benefits and drawbacks.

The following table lists common and recommended alert rules for Public IP addresses.

| Alert type | Condition | Description  |
|:---|:---|:---|
| Under DDoS attack or not | **GreaterThan** 0. </br> **1** is currently under attack. </br> **0** indicates normal activity | As part of Azure's edge protection, public IP addresses are monitored for DDoS attacks. An alert will allow you to be notified if your public IP address is affected. |
