# What is Logz.io integration with Azure?

Logz.io's Cloud-Native Observability Platform centralizes log, metric, and tracing analytics in one place, so you can monitor the health and performance of your Azure environment. You manage your solution through the Azure portal.

The Logz.io offering in the Azure Marketplace is an integrated service in Azure. This integration means you can implement Logz.io as a monitoring solution for your cloud workloads through a streamlined workflow.

You can now provision the Logz.io resources through a resource provider named `Microsoft.Logz`. You can create, provision, and manage Logz.io resources through the Azure portal. Logz.io owns and runs the software as a service (SaaS) application and that includes the Logz.io accounts and related API keys.
