# Migrate from EA Balance Summary API

EA customers who were previously using the Enterprise Reporting consumption.azure.com API to get their balance summary need to migrate to a replacement Azure Resource Manager API. Instructions to do this are outlined below along with any contract differences between the old API and the new API.

## Assign permissions to an SPN to call the API

Before calling the API, you need to configure a Service Principal with the correct permission. You use the service principal to call the API. For more information, see [Assign permissions to ACM APIs](cost-management-api-permissions.md).

### Call the Balance Summary API

Use the following request URIs when calling the new Balance Summary API. Your enrollment number should be used as the `billingAccountId`.

#### Supported requests

[Get for Enrollment](/rest/api/consumption/balances/getbybillingaccount)


```http
https://management.azure.com/providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}/providers/Microsoft.Consumption/balances?api-version=2019-10-01
```

### Response body changes
