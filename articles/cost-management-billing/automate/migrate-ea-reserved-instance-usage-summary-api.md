# Migrate from EA Reserved Instance Usage Summary API

EA customers who were previously using the Enterprise Reporting consumption.azure.com API to obtain reserved instance usage summaries need to migrate to a parity Azure Resource Manager API. Instructions to do this are outlined below along with any contract differences between the old API and the new API.

## Assign permissions to an SPN to call the API

Before calling the API, you need to configure a Service Principal with the correct permission. You use the service principal to call the API. For more information, see [Assign permissions to ACM APIs](cost-management-api-permissions.md).

### Call the Reserved Instance Usage Summary API

Use the following request URIs to call the new Reservation Summaries API.

#### Supported requests

Call the API with the following scopes:

- Enrollment: `providers/Microsoft.Billing/billingAccounts/{billingAccountId}`

[Get Reservation Summary Daily](/rest/api/consumption/reservationssummaries/list#reservationsummariesdailywithbillingaccountid)

```http
https://management.azure.com/{scope}/Microsoft.Consumption/reservationSummaries?grain=daily&$filter=properties/usageDate ge 2017-10-01 AND properties/usageDate le 2017-11-20&api-version=2019-10-01 
```

```

#### Response body changes

Old response:

```json
[
     {
        "reservationOrderId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",
        "reservationId": "00000000-0000-0000-0000-000000000000",

        "avgUtilizationPercentage": 95.83,

    }
]
```

New response:
