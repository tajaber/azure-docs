# Get started with your Enterprise Agreement billing account

This article helps direct and indirect Azure Enterprise Agreement (Azure EA) customers with their billing administration on the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com). Get basic information about:

- Roles used to manage the Enterprise billing account in the Azure portal
- Subscription creation
- Cost analysis in the Azure portal

> [!NOTE]
> We recommend that both direct and indirect EA Azure customers use Cost Management + Billing in the Azure portal to manage their enrollment and billing instead of using the EA portal. For more information about enrollment management in the Azure portal, see [Get started with EA billing in the Azure portal](ea-direct-portal-get-started.md).
>
> As of February 20, 2023 indirect EA customers won’t be able to manage their billing account in the EA portal. Instead, they must use the Azure portal. 
> 
> This change doesn’t affect Azure Government EA enrollments. They continue using the EA portal to manage their enrollment.

We have several videos that walk you through getting started with the Azure portal for Enterprise Agreements. Check out the series at [Enterprise Customer Billing Experience in the Azure portal](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeZrVF6SXmsoHSnAgrDDzL0W5j8KevFIm).

Here's the first video.

## Understanding EA user roles and introduction to user hierarchy

To help manage your organization's usage and spend, Azure Enterprise Agreement (EA) administrators can assign the following distinct administrative roles:

- Enterprise Administrator
- Enterprise Administrator (read only)
- Department Administrator
- Department Administrator (read only)
- Account Owner

Each role has a varying degree of user limits and permissions. For more information, see [Organization structure and permissions by role](understand-ea-roles.md#organization-structure-and-permissions-by-role).

## Activate your enrollment, create a subscription, and other administrative tasks

For more information about activating your enrollment, creating a department or subscription, adding administrators and account owners, and other administrative tasks, see [Azure EA billing administration](direct-ea-administration.md).

If you’d like to know more about transferring an Enterprise subscription to a Pay-As-You-Go subscription, see [Azure Enterprise transfers](ea-transfers.md).

## View your enterprise department and account lists

If you’d like to view all the departments and accounts in your billing account, use the following steps.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Navigate to **Cost Management + Billing**.
1. In the left menu, select **Billing scopes** and then select a billing account scope.
1. In the navigation menu, select **Department** or **Account** to view its details.

## View usage summary and download reports

You view a summary of your usage data, Azure Prepayment consumed, and charges associated with other usage in the Azure portal. Charges are presented at the summary level across all accounts and subscriptions of the enrollment.
To view a usage summary, price sheet, and download reports, see [Review usage charges](direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices.md#review-usage-charges).

## View and download invoice

As a direct EA customer, you can view and download your Azure EA invoice in the Azure portal. It's a self-serve capability and an EA admin of a direct EA enrollment has access to manage invoices. Your invoice is a representation of your bill and should be reviewed for accuracy. For more information, see [Download or view your Azure billing invoice](direct-ea-azure-usage-charges-invoices.md#download-or-view-your-azure-billing-invoice).

## View Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC)

You view and track your Microsoft Azure Consumption Commitment (MACC) in the Azure portal. If your organization has a MACC for an EA billing account, you can check important aspects of your commitment, including start and end dates, remaining commitment, and eligible spend in the Azure portal. For more information, see [MACC overview](track-consumption-commitment.md?tabs=portal.md#track-your-macc-commitment).
