# Pay for your Azure subscription by wire transfer

This article applies to customers with a Microsoft Customer Agreement (MCA) and to customers who signed up for Azure through the Azure website (for a Microsoft Online Services Program account also called pay-as-you-go account). If you signed up for Azure through a Microsoft representative, then your default payment method is already be set to *wire transfer*.

[!INCLUDE [Pay by check](../../../includes/cost-management-pay-check.md)]

If you switch to pay by wire transfer, that means you pay your bill within 30 days of the invoice date by wire transfer.

When you request to change your payment method to wire transfer, there are two possible results:

- You're automatically approved and you're prompted for information about your company.
- You're not automatically approved, but you can submit a request to Azure support.

Users with a Microsoft Customer Agreement must always submit a request to Azure support to enable pay by wire transfer.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> * Pay by wire transfer is only available for customers using Azure on behalf of a company.
> * Pay all outstanding charges before switching to pay by wire transfer.
> * An outstanding invoice is paid by your default payment method. In order to have it paid by wire transfer, you must change your default payment method to wire transfer after you've been approved.
> * Currently, payment by wire transfer isn't supported for Global Azure in China.
> * For Microsoft Online Services Program accounts, if you switch to pay by wire transfer, you can't switch back to paying by credit or debit card.
> * Currently, only customers in the United States can get automatically approved to change their payment method to wire transfer. Support for other regions is being evaluated.
