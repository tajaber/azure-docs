# Savings plan scopes

Setting the scope for a savings plan selects where the benefits apply.

You have the following options to scope a savings plan, depending on your needs:

## Scope options

- **Single resource group scope** - Applies the savings plan benefit to the eligible resources in the selected resource group only.
- **Single subscription scope** - Applies the savings plan benefit to the eligible resources in the selected subscription.
- **Shared scope** - Applies the savings plan benefit to eligible resources within subscriptions that are in the billing context. If a subscription was moved to different billing context, the benefit will no longer be applied to this subscription and will continue to apply to other subscriptions in the billing context.
  - For Enterprise Agreement customers, the billing context is the enrollment.
  - For Microsoft Customer Agreement customers, the billing scope is the billing profile.
- **Management group** - Applies the savings plan benefit to eligible resources in the list of subscriptions that are a part of both the management group and billing scope. To buy a savings plan for a management group, you must have at least read permission on the management group and be a savings plan owner on the billing subscription.

## Scope processing order

While applying savings plan benefits to your usage, Azure processes savings plans in the following order:

1. Savings plans with a single resource group scope.
2. Savings plans with a single subscription scope.
3. Savings plans scoped to a management group.
4. Savings plans with a shared scope (multiple subscriptions), described previously.

You can always update the scope after you buy a savings plan. To do so, go to the savings plan, select **Configuration**, and rescope the savings plan. Rescoping a savings plan isn't a commercial transaction, so your savings plan term isn't changed. For more information about updating the scope, see [Update the scope](manage-savings-plan.md#change-the-savings-plan-scope) after you purchase a savings plan.
