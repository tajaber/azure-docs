> [!WARNING]
> We do not recommend that you use data directly from the artifacts folder for production purposes. Artifacts are intermediate outputs of the indexing process. They are essentially raw outputs of the various AI engines that analyze the videos; the artifacts schema may change over time. It is recommended that you use the [Get Video Index](https://api-portal.videoindexer.ai/api-details#api=Operations&operation=Get-Video-Index) API, as described in [Get insights and artifacts produced by the API](../insights-overview.md#get-insights-produced-by-the-api).
