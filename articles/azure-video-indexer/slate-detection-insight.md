# The slate detection insights (preview)

The following slate detection insights (listed below) are automatically identified when indexing a video using the advanced indexing option. These insights are most useful to customers involved in the movie post-production process.

* [Clapperboard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clapperboard) detection with metadata extraction. This insight is used to detect clapperboard instances and information written on each (for example, *production*, *roll*, *scene*, *take*, etc. 
* Digital patterns detection, including [color bars](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SMPTE_color_bars). 
* Textless slate detection, including scene matching.
