- There can be a mismatch if the input video is of low quality (for example â€“ old Analog recordings). 
- The digital patterns will be identified over the 10 min of the beginning and 10 min of the ending part of the video.  
<!-- -  What about the limited set of digital patterns that we compare to? It's not any digital pattern -->
