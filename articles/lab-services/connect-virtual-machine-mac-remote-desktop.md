# Connect to a VM using Remote Desktop Protocol on a Mac

In this article, you learn how to connect to a lab VM in Azure Lab Services from a Mac by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

## Install Microsoft Remote Desktop on a Mac

To connect to the lab VM via RDP, you can use the Microsoft Remote Desktop app.

To install the Microsoft Remote Desktop app:

1. Open the App Store on your Mac, and search for **Microsoft Remote Desktop**.

1. Select **Install** to install the latest version of Microsoft Remote Desktop.

## Access the VM from your Mac using RDP

Next, you connect to the lab VM by using the remote desktop application. You can retrieve the connection information for the lab VM from the Azure Lab Services website.

1. Navigate to the Azure Lab Services website (https://labs.azure.com), and sign in with your credentials.

1. On the tile for your VM, ensure the [VM is running](how-to-use-lab.md#start-or-stop-the-vm) and select the **Connect** icon.

1. If youâ€™re connecting to a Linux VM, you'll see two options to connect to the VM: SSH and RDP.  Select the **Connect via RDP** option. If you're connecting to a Windows VM, you don't need to choose a connection option.  The RDP file will automatically start downloading.

1. Open the **RDP** file that's downloaded on your computer with **Microsoft Remote Desktop** installed. It should start connecting to the VM.
