# Connect to a VM using Remote Desktop Protocol on a Chromebook

In this article, you learn how to connect to a lab VM in Azure Lab Services from a Chromebook by using Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP).

## Install Microsoft Remote Desktop on a Chromebook

To connect to the lab VM via RDP, you use the Microsoft Remote Desktop app.

To install the Microsoft Remote Desktop app:

1. Open the app store on your Chromebook, and search for **Microsoft Remote Desktop**.

1. Select **Install** to install the latest version of the Remote Desktop application by Microsoft Corporation.

## Access the VM from your Chromebook using RDP

Next, you connect to the lab VM by using the remote desktop application. You can retrieve the connection information for the lab VM from the Azure Lab Services website.

1. Navigate to the Azure Lab Services website (https://labs.azure.com), and sign in with your credentials.

1. On the tile for your VM, ensure the [VM is running](how-to-use-lab.md#start-or-stop-the-vm) and select the **Connect** icon.

1. If youâ€™re connecting to a Linux VM, you'll see two options to connect to the VM: SSH and RDP.  Select the **Connect via RDP** option. If you're connecting to a Windows VM, you don't need to choose a connection option.  The RDP file will automatically start downloading.

1. Open the **RDP** file that's downloaded on your computer with **Microsoft Remote Desktop** installed. It should start connecting to the VM.
