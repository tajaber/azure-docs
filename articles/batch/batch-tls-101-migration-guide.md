# Migrate client code to TLS 1.2 in Batch

To support security best practices and remain in compliance with industry standards, Azure Batch will retire Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.0 and TLS 1.1 in Azure Batch on *March 31, 2023*. Learn how to migrate to TLS 1.2 in your Batch service client code.

## End of support for TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 in Batch

TLS versions 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are known to be susceptible to BEAST and POODLE attacks and to have other Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) weaknesses. TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 don't support the modern encryption methods and cipher suites that the Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance standards recommends. Microsoft is participating in an industry-wide push toward the exclusive use of TLS version 1.2 or later.

If you've already migrated to use TLS 1.2 in your Batch client applications, then this retirement doesn't apply to you. Only API requests that go directly to the Batch service via the data plane API (not management plane) are impacted. API requests at the management plane layer are routed through ARM and are subject to ARM TLS minimum version requirements. We recommend that you migrate to TLS 1.2 across Batch data plane or management plane API calls for security best practices, if possible.

## Alternative: Use TLS 1.2

To avoid disruption to your Batch workflows, you must update your client code to use TLS 1.2 before the TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 retirement in Batch on March 31, 2023.

For specific development use cases, see the following information:

- If you use native WinHTTP for your client application code, see the guidance in [Update to enable TLS 1.1 and TLS 1.2 as default security protocols](https://support.microsoft.com/topic/update-to-enable-tls-1-1-and-tls-1-2-as-default-secure-protocols-in-winhttp-in-windows-c4bd73d2-31d7-761e-0178-11268bb10392).

- If you use the .NET Framework for your client application code, upgrade to .NET 4.7 or later. Beginning in .NET 4.7, TLS 1.2 is enforced by default.

- If you use the .NET Framework and you *can't* upgrade to .NET 4.7 or later, see the guidance in [TLS for network programming](/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls) to enforce TLS 1.2.

For more information, see [TLS best practices for the .NET Framework](/dotnet/framework/network-programming/tls).

## FAQs

- Why do I need to upgrade to TLS 1.2?

   TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 are considered insecure and have security issues that are addressed in TLS 1.2. TLS 1.2 has been available since 2008. TLS 1.2 is widely adopted as the minimum version for securing communication channels using TLS.

- What happens if I don't upgrade?

   After the feature retirement from Azure Batch, your client application won't be able to communicate with Batch data plane API services unless you upgrade to TLS 1.2.

- Does upgrading to TLS 1.2 affect the performance of my application?

   Upgrading to TLS 1.2 generally shouldn't affect your application's performance.

- How do I know if Iâ€™m using TLS 1.0 or TLS 1.1?

   To determine the TLS version you're using, check your client application logs and the audit log for your Batch deployment.
