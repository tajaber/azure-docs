# Generate P2S Azure VPN Client profile configuration files - Azure AD authentication

This article helps you generate and extract VPN client profile configuration files. Client profile configuration files contain information that's used to configure your VPN client. The sections in this article explain the information needed to configure the Azure VPN Client profile for Azure VPN Gateway point-to-site configurations that use Azure AD authentication.

## <a name="generate"></a>Generate profile files

You can generate VPN client profile configuration files either with PowerShell, or the Azure portal. Either method returns the same zip file.

### Portal

1. In the Azure portal, go to the virtual network gateway for the virtual network that you want to connect to.
1. On the virtual network gateway page, select **Point-to-site configuration**.
1. At the top of the point-to-site configuration page, select **Download VPN client**. It takes a few minutes for the client configuration package to generate.
1. Your browser indicates that a client configuration zip file is available. It's named the same name as your gateway. Unzip the file to view the folders.

### PowerShell

To generate using PowerShell, you can use the following example:

1. When generating VPN client configuration files, the value for '-AuthenticationMethod' is 'EapTls'. Generate the VPN client configuration files using the following command:

   ```azurepowershell-interactive
   $profile=New-AzVpnClientConfiguration -ResourceGroupName "TestRG" -Name "VNet1GW" -AuthenticationMethod "EapTls"

   $profile.VPNProfileSASUrl
   ```

1. Copy the URL to your browser to download the zip file, then unzip the file to view the folders.

## <a name="extract"></a>Extract the zip file

Extract the zip file. The file contains the following folders:

* **AzureVPN**: The AzureVPN folder contains the **Azurevpnconfig.xml** file that is used to configure the Azure VPN Client.
* **Generic**: The generic folder contains the public server certificate and the VpnSettings.xml file. The VpnSettings.xml file contains information needed to configure a generic client

## <a name="get"></a>Retrieve file information

In the **AzureVPN** folder, go to the ***azurevpnconfig.xml*** file and open it with Notepad. Make a note of the text between the following tags. This information is used later when configuring the Azure VPN Client.

```
<audience>          </audience>
<issuer>            </issuer>
<tennant>           </tennant>
<fqdn>              </fqdn>
<serversecret>      </serversecret>
```

## <a name="details"></a>Profile details

When you add a connection, use the information you collected in the previous step for the profile details page. The fields correspond to the following information:

* **Audience:** Identifies the recipient resource the token is intended for.
* **Issuer:** Identifies the Security Token Service (STS) that emitted the token, and the Azure AD tenant.
* **Tenant:** Contains an immutable, unique identifier of the directory tenant that issued the token.
* **FQDN:** The fully qualified domain name (FQDN) on the Azure VPN gateway.
* **ServerSecret:** The VPN gateway preshared key.
