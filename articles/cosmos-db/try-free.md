# Try Azure Cosmos DB free

[!INCLUDE[NoSQL, MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, Table, PostgreSQL](includes/appliesto-nosql-mongodb-cassandra-gremlin-table-postgresql.md)]

[Try Azure Cosmos DB](https://aka.ms/trycosmosdb) makes it easy to try out Azure Cosmos DB for free before you commit. There's no credit card required to get started. Your account is free for 30 days. After expiration, a new sandbox account can be created. You can extend beyond 30 days for 24 hours. You can upgrade your active Try Azure Cosmos DB account at any time during the 30 day trial period.

If you're using the API for NoSQL or PostgreSQL, you can also migrate your Try Azure Cosmos DB data to your upgraded account before the trial ends.

This article walks you through how to create your account, limits, and upgrading your account. This article also walks through how to migrate your data from your Try Azure Cosmos DB sandbox to your own account using the API for NoSQL.

## Limits to free account

### [NoSQL / Cassandra/ Gremlin / Table](#tab/nosql+cassandra+gremlin+table)

The following table lists the limits for the [Try Azure Cosmos DB](https://aka.ms/trycosmosdb) for Free trial.

## Create your Try Azure Cosmos DB account

From the [Try Azure Cosmos DB home page](https://aka.ms/trycosmosdb), select an API. Azure Cosmos DB provides five APIs: NoSQL and MongoDB for document data, Gremlin for graph data, Azure Table, and Cassandra.

> [!NOTE]
> Not sure which API will best meet your needs? To learn more about the APIs for Azure Cosmos DB, see [Choose an API in Azure Cosmos DB](choose-api.md).

## Launch a Quick Start

Launch the Quickstart in Data Explorer in Azure portal to start using Azure Cosmos DB or get started with our documentation.

* [API for NoSQL](nosql/quickstart-portal.md#create-container-database)
* [API for PostgreSQL](postgresql/quickstart-create-portal.md)
* [API for MongoDB](mongodb/quickstart-python.md#object-model)
* [API for Apache Cassandra](cassandra/adoption.md)
* [API for Apache Gremlin](gremlin/quickstart-console.md#add-a-graph)
* [API for Table](table/quickstart-dotnet.md)

You can also get started with one of the learning resources in the Data Explorer.

## Upgrade your account

Your account is free for 30 days. After expiration, a new sandbox account can be created. You can upgrade your active Try Azure Cosmos DB account at any time during the 30 day trial period. Here are the steps to start an upgrade.

### Start upgrade

1. From either the Azure portal or the Try Azure Cosmos DB free page, select the option to **Upgrade** your account.

    :::image type="content" source="media/try-free/upgrade-account.png" lightbox="media/try-free/upgrade-account.png" alt-text="Screenshot of the confirmation page for the account upgrade experience.":::

1. Choose to either **Sign up for an Azure account** or **Sign in** and create a new Azure Cosmos DB account following the instructions in the next section.

### Create a new account

#### [NoSQL / MongoDB / Cassandra / Gremlin / Table](#tab/nosql+mongodb+cassandra+gremlin+table)

> [!NOTE]
> While this example uses API for NoSQL, the steps are similar for the APIs for MongoDB, Cassandra, Gremlin, or Table.
