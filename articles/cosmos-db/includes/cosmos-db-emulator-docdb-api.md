You can [try Azure Cosmos DB for free](../try-free.md), without an Azure subscription, and with no commitment required. Alternatively, you can create an [Azure Cosmos DB free tier account](../optimize-dev-test.md#azure-cosmos-db-free-tier), with the first 1000 RU/s and 25 GB of storage for free. You can also use the [Azure Cosmos DB emulator](../local-emulator.md) with a URI of `https://localhost:8081`. For the key to use with the emulator, see [Authenticating requests](../local-emulator.md#authenticate-requests).
