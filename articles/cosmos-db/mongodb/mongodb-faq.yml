summary: |
  [!INCLUDE[MongoDB](../includes/appliesto-mongodb.md)]
  
  The Azure Cosmos DB's API for MongoDB is a wire-protocol compatibility layer that allows applications to easily and transparently communicate with the native Azure Cosmos DB database engine by using existing, community-supported SDKs and drivers for MongoDB. Developers can now use existing MongoDB toolchains and skills to build applications that take advantage of Azure Cosmos DB. Developers benefit from the unique capabilities of Azure Cosmos DB, which include global distribution with multi-region write replication, auto-indexing, backup maintenance, financially backed service level agreements (SLAs) etc.
