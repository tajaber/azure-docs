[Tom Sawyer Graph Database Browser](https://www.tomsawyer.com/graph-database-browser/) makes it easy to visualize and analyze data in Azure Cosmos DB for Gremlin. The Graph Database Browser helps you see and understand connections in your data without extensive knowledge of the query language or the schema. You can manually define the schema for your project or use schema extraction to create it. So, even less technical users can interact with the data by loading the neighbors of selected nodes and building the visualization in whatever direction they need. Advanced users can execute queries using Gremlin, Cypher, or SPARQL to gain other insights. When you define the schema then you can load the Azure Cosmos DB data into the Perspectives model. With the help of integrator definition, you can specify the location and configuration for the Gremlin endpoint. Later you can bind elements from the Azure Cosmos DB data source to elements in the Perspectives model and visualize your data.

Users of all skill levels can take advantage of five unique graph layouts to display the graph in a way that provides the most meaning. And there are built-in centrality, clustering, and path-finding analyses to reveal previously unseen patterns. Using these techniques, organizations can identify critical patterns in areas like fraud detection, customer intelligence, and cybersecurity. Pattern recognition is very important for network analysts in areas such as general IT and network management, logistics, legacy system migration, and business transformation.

## Graphlytic

Graphlytic is a highly customizable web application for graph visualization and analysis. Users can interactively explore the graph, look for patterns with the Gremlin language, or use filters to find answers to any graph question. Graph rendering is done with the 'Cytoscape.js' library, which allows Graphlytic to render tens of thousands of nodes and hundreds of thousands of relationships at once.

Graphlytic is compatible with Azure Cosmos DB and can be deployed to Azure in minutes. Graphlytic’s UI can be customized and extended in many ways, for instance the default [visualization configuration](https://graphlytic.biz/doc/latest/Visualization_Settings.html), [data schema](https://graphlytic.biz/doc/latest/Data_Schema.html), [style mappings](https://graphlytic.biz/doc/latest/Style_Mappers.html), [virtual properties](https://graphlytic.biz/doc/latest/Virtual_properties.html) in the visualization, or custom implemented [widgets](https://graphlytic.biz/doc/latest/Widgets.html) that can enhance the visualization features with bespoke reports or integrations.

The following are two example scenarios:

* **IT Management use case**
Companies running their IT operations on their own infrastructure, Telco, or IP providers, all need a solid network documentation and a functional configuration management. Impact analyses describing interdependencies among network elements (active and passive) are being developed to overcome blackouts, which cause significant financial losses, or even single outages causing no or low availability of service. Bottlenecks and single points of failure are determined and solved. Endpoint as well as route redundancies are being implemented.
Graphlytic property graph visualization is a perfect enabler for all above mentioned points - network documentation, network configuration management, impact analysis and asset management. It stores and depicts all relevant network configuration information in one place, bringing a completely new added value to IT managers and field technicians.

* **Anti-fraud use case**
Fraud pattern is a well-known term to every single insurance company, bank or e-commerce enterprise. Modern fraudsters build sophisticated fraud rings and schemes that are hard to unveil with traditional tools. It can cause serious losses if not detected properly and on time. On the other hand, traditional red flag systems with too strict criteria must be adjusted to eliminate false positive indicators, as it would lead to overwhelming fraud indications. Great amounts of time are spent trying to detect complex fraud, paralyzing investigators in their daily tasks.
The basic idea behind Graphlytic is the fact that the human eye can simply distinguish and find any pattern in a graphical form much easier than in any table or data set. It means that the antifraud analyst can capture fraud schemes within graph visualization more easily, faster and smarter than with solely traditional tools.

This allows the user to experience highly versatile and sophisticated diagram visualization in applications across many diverse areas.

Azure Cosmos DB can be queried for data using Gremlin, an efficient graph traversal language. The user can query the database for the stored entities and use the relationships to traverse the connected neighborhood. This approach requires in-depth technical knowledge of the database itself and also the query language Gremlin to explore the stored data. Where as with yWorks visualization you can visually explore the Azure Cosmos DB data, identify significant structures, and get a better understanding of relationships. Besides the visual exploration, you can also interactively edit the stored data by modifying the diagram without any knowledge of the associated query language like Gremlin. This way it provides a high-quality visualization and can analyze large data sets from Azure Cosmos DB data. You can use yFiles to add visualization capabilities to your own applications, dashboards, and reports, or to create new, white-label apps and tools for both in-house and customer facing products.
