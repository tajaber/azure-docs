# Quickstart: Create an open-source Redis cache

Azure Cache for Redis provides fully managed [open-source Redis](https://redis.io/) within Azure.

This quickstart demonstrates how to use the Azure portal to create a new Azure Cache for Redis.

## Prerequisites

You'll need an Azure subscription before you begin. If you don't have one, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) first.
