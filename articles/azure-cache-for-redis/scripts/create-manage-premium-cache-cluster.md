# Create a Premium Azure Cache for Redis with clustering

In this scenario, you learn how to create a 6 GB Premium tier Azure Cache for Redis with clustering enabled and two shards. You then learn to get details of an Azure Cache for Redis instance, including provisioning status, the hostname, ports, and keys for an Azure Cache for Redis instance. Finally, you learn to delete the cache.
