# Quickstart: Use GitHub Actions to connect to Azure MySQL

[!INCLUDE[applies-to-mysql-single-flexible-server](../includes/applies-to-mysql-single-flexible-server.md)]

[!INCLUDE[azure-database-for-mysql-single-server-deprecation](../includes/azure-database-for-mysql-single-server-deprecation.md)]

Get started with [GitHub Actions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions) by using a workflow to deploy database updates to [Azure Database for MySQL](https://azure.microsoft.com/services/mysql/).

## Prerequisites

You'll need:

- An Azure account with an active subscription. [Create an account for free](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F).
- A GitHub account. If you don't have a GitHub account, [sign up for free](https://github.com/join).
- A GitHub repository with sample data (`data.sql`).

    > [!IMPORTANT]
    > This quickstart assumes that you have cloned a GitHub repository to your computer so that you can add the associated IP address to a firewall rule, if necessary.

- An Azure Database for MySQL server.
  - [Quickstart: Create an Azure Database for MySQL server in the Azure portal](quickstart-create-mysql-server-database-using-azure-portal.md)

## Workflow file overview

A GitHub Actions workflow is defined by a YAML (.yml) file in the `/.github/workflows/` path in your repository. This definition contains the various steps and parameters that make up the workflow.

The file has two sections:

|Section  |Tasks  |
|---------|---------|
|**Authentication** | 1. Generate deployment credentials. |
|**Deploy** | 1. Deploy the database. |

## Generate deployment credentials

[!INCLUDE [include](~/articles/reusable-content/github-actions/generate-deployment-credentials.md)]

## Copy the MySQL connection string

In the Azure portal, go to your Azure Database for MySQL server and open **Settings** > **Connection strings**. Copy the **ADO.NET** connection string. Replace the placeholder values for `your_database` and `your_password`. The connection string looks similar to the following.

> [!IMPORTANT]
>
> - For Single server use **Uid=adminusername@servername**. Note the **@servername** is required.
> - For Flexible server , use **Uid= adminusername** without the @servername.

```output
   Server=my-mysql-server.mysql.database.azure.com; Port=3306; Database={your_database}; Uid=adminname@my-mysql-server; Pwd={your_password}; SslMode=Preferred;
```

You'll use the connection string as a GitHub secret.

## Configure GitHub secrets

[!INCLUDE [include](~/articles/reusable-content/github-actions/create-secrets-with-openid.md)]

## Add your workflow

1. Go to **Actions** for your GitHub repository.

2. Select **Set up your workflow yourself**.

3. Delete everything after the `on:` section of your workflow file. For example, your remaining workflow may look like this.

    ```yaml
    name: CI

    on:
    push:
        branches: [ main ]
    pull_request:
        branches: [ main ]
    ```

4. Rename your workflow `MySQL for GitHub Actions` and add the checkout and login actions. These actions check out your site code and authenticate with Azure using the `AZURE_CREDENTIALS` GitHub secret you created earlier.

    # [Service principal](#tab/userlevel)
    
    ```yaml
    name: MySQL for GitHub Actions
    
    on:
        push:
            branches: [ main ]
        pull_request:
            branches: [ main ]
    
    jobs:
        build:
            runs-on: windows-latest
            steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v1
            - uses: azure/login@v1
                with:
                    creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
      ```
    
    # [OpenID Connect](#tab/openid)
    
    ```yaml
    name: MySQL for GitHub Actions
    
    on:
        push:
            branches: [ main ]
        pull_request:
            branches: [ main ]
    
    jobs:
        build:
            runs-on: windows-latest
            steps:
            - uses: actions/checkout@v1
            - uses: azure/login@v1
                with:
                  client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
                  tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
                  subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
    ```
    
    ___

5. Use the Azure MySQL Deploy action to connect to your MySQL instance. Replace `MYSQL_SERVER_NAME` with the name of your server. You should have a MySQL data file named `data.sql` at the root level of your repository.

    ```yaml
    - uses: azure/mysql@v1
      with:
        server-name: MYSQL_SERVER_NAME
        connection-string: ${{ secrets.AZURE_MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING }}
        sql-file: './data.sql'
    ```

6. Complete your workflow by adding an action to sign out of Azure. Here's the completed workflow. The file appears in the `.github/workflows` folder of your repository.

    # [Service principal](#tab/userlevel)
    
    ```yaml
    name: MySQL for GitHub Actions
    
    on:
      push:
          branches: [ main ]
      pull_request:
          branches: [ main ]
    jobs:
        build:
            runs-on: windows-latest
            steps:
              - uses: actions/checkout@v1
              - uses: azure/login@v1
                with:
                  creds: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CREDENTIALS }}
    
              - uses: azure/mysql@v1
                with:
                  server-name: MYSQL_SERVER_NAME
                  connection-string: ${{ secrets.AZURE_MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING }}
                  sql-file: './data.sql'
    
                # Azure logout
              - name: logout
                run: |
                  az logout
    ```
    # [OpenID Connect](#tab/openid)
    
    ```yaml
    name: MySQL for GitHub Actions
  
    on:
      push:
          branches: [ main ]
      pull_request:
          branches: [ main ]
    jobs:
        build:
            runs-on: windows-latest
            steps:
              - uses: actions/checkout@v1
              - uses: azure/login@v1
                with:
                  client-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_CLIENT_ID }}
                  tenant-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_TENANT_ID }}
                  subscription-id: ${{ secrets.AZURE_SUBSCRIPTION_ID }}
              - uses: azure/mysql@v1
                with:
                  server-name: MYSQL_SERVER_NAME
                  connection-string: ${{ secrets.AZURE_MYSQL_CONNECTION_STRING }}
                  sql-file: './data.sql'
  
                # Azure logout
              - name: logout
                run: |
                  az logout
    ```

## Review your deployment

1. Go to **Actions** for your GitHub repository.

2. Open the first result to see detailed logs of your workflow's run.

## Clean up resources

When your Azure MySQL database and repository are no longer needed, clean up the resources you deployed by deleting the resource group and your GitHub repository.
