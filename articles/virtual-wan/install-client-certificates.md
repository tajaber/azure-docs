# Install client certificates for User VPN connections

When a Virtual WAN User VPN P2S configuration is configured for certificate authentication, each client computer must have a client certificate installed locally. This article helps you install a client certificate locally on a client computer. You can also use [Intune](/mem/intune/configuration/vpn-settings-configure) to install certain VPN client profiles and certificates.

If you want to generate a client certificate, see [Generate and export certificates for User VPN connections](certificates-point-to-site.md).

## <a name="installwin"></a>Windows

[!INCLUDE [Install on Windows](../../includes/vpn-gateway-certificates-install-client-cert-include.md)]

## <a name="installmac"></a>macOS

[!INCLUDE [Install on Mac](../../includes/vpn-gateway-certificates-install-mac-client-cert-include.md)]

## <a name="installlinux"></a>Linux

The Linux client certificate is installed on the client as part of the client configuration. Use the VPN Gateway [Client configuration - Linux](../vpn-gateway/point-to-site-vpn-client-cert-linux.md) instructions.
