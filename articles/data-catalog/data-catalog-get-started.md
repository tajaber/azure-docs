# Quickstart: Create an Azure Data Catalog via the Azure portal

[!INCLUDE [Microsoft Purview redirect](includes/catalog-to-purview-migration-flag.md)]

Azure Data Catalog is a fully managed cloud service that serves as a system of registration and system of discovery for enterprise data assets. For a detailed overview, see [What is Azure Data Catalog](overview.md).

This quickstart helps you get started with creating an Azure Data Catalog.

If you donâ€™t have an Azure subscription, create a [free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/?WT.mc_id=A261C142F) before you begin.

## Prerequisites

> [!Note]
> Due to Azure security requirements, Azure Data Catalog has enfored Transport Layer Security (TLS) 1.2. TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 have been disabled. You may encounter errors running the registration tool if your machine is not updated for TLS 1.2. See [Enable Transport Layer Security (1.2)](/mem/configmgr/core/plan-design/security/enable-tls-1-2) to update your machine for TLS 1.2.

To get started, you need to have:

* A [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/) subscription.
* You need to have your own [Azure Active Directory tenant](../active-directory/fundamentals/active-directory-access-create-new-tenant.md).

To set up Data Catalog, you must be the owner or co-owner of an Azure subscription.

## Create a data catalog

You can create only one data catalog per organization (Azure Active Directory domain). Therefore, if the owner or co-owner of an Azure subscription who belongs to this Azure Active Directory domain has already created a catalog, then you can't create a catalog again even if you have multiple Azure subscriptions. To test whether a data catalog has been created by a user in your Azure Active Directory domain, go to the [Azure Data Catalog home page](http://azuredatacatalog.com) and verify whether you see the catalog. If a catalog has already been created for you, skip the following procedure and go to the next section.

1. Go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) > **Create a resource** and select **Data Catalog**.

## Find a data catalog in the Azure portal

1. On a separate tab in the web browser or in a separate web browser window, go to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com) and sign in with the same account that you used to create the data catalog in the previous step.

1. Select **All services** and then select **Data Catalog**.

    :::image type="content" source="media/data-catalog-get-started/data-catalog-browse-azure-portal.png" alt-text="The left Azure portal menu is open, with 'all services' selected. In the services menu, Data Catalog is selected.":::

    You'll see the data catalog you created in the list. If you don't, check your subscription, resource group, location, and tag filters at the top of the search.

1. Select the catalog that you created. You'll see the **Data Catalog** page in the portal, showing details for your Data Catalog.

1. You can view properties of the data catalog and update them. For example, you can select **Pricing tier** and change the edition.
