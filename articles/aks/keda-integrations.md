# Integrations with Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) on Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) (Preview)

The Kubernetes Event-driven Autoscaling (KEDA) add-on integrates with features provided by Azure and open source projects.

[!INCLUDE [preview features callout](./includes/preview/preview-callout.md)]

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Integrations with open source projects are not covered by the [AKS support policy][aks-support-policy].

## Observe your autoscaling with Kubernetes events

KEDA automatically emits Kubernetes events allowing customers to operate their application autoscaling.

To learn about the available metrics, we recommend reading the [KEDA documentation][keda-event-docs].

## Scalers for Azure services

KEDA can integrate with various tools and services through [a rich catalog of 50+ KEDA scalers][keda-scalers]. It supports leading cloud platforms (such as Azure) and open-source technologies such as Redis and Kafka.

It leverages the following scalers for Azure services:

- [Azure Application Insights](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-app-insights/)
- [Azure Blob Storage](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-storage-blob/)
- [Azure Data Explorer](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-data-explorer/)
- [Azure Event Hubs](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-event-hub/)
- [Azure Log Analytics](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-log-analytics/)
- [Azure Monitor](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-monitor/)
- [Azure Pipelines](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-pipelines/)
- [Azure Service Bus](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-service-bus/)
- [Azure Storage Queue](https://keda.sh/docs/latest/scalers/azure-storage-queue/)

Next to the built-in scalers, you can install external scalers yourself to autoscale on other Azure services:

- [Azure Cosmos DB (Change feed)](https://github.com/kedacore/external-scaler-azure-cosmos-db)

However, these external scalers aren't supported as part of the add-on and rely on community support.
