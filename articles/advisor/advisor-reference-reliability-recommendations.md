## API Management

### Hostname certificate rotation failed

API Management service failed to refresh hostname certificate from Key Vault. Ensure that certificate exists in Key Vault and API Management service identity is granted secret read access. Otherwise, API Management service will not be able to retrieve certificate updates from Key Vault, which may lead to the service using stale certificate and runtime API traffic being blocked as a result.

Learn more about [Api Management - HostnameCertRotationFail (Hostname certificate rotation failed)](https://aka.ms/apimdocs/customdomain).

### SSL/TLS renegotiation blocked

SSL/TLS renegotiation attempt blocked. Renegotiation happens when a client certificate is requested over an already established connection. When it is blocked, reading 'context.Request.Certificate' in policy expressions will return 'null'. To support client certificate authentication scenarios, enable 'Negotiate client certificate' on listed hostnames. For browser-based clients, enabling this option might result in a certificate prompt being presented to the client.

Learn more about [Api Management - TlsRenegotiationBlocked (SSL/TLS renegotiation blocked)](../api-management/api-management-howto-mutual-certificates-for-clients.md).

## App

### Increase the minimal replica count for your container app

We detected the minimal replica count set for your container app may be lower than optimal. Consider increasing the minimal replica count for better availability.

Learn more about [Resource - ContainerAppMinimalReplicaCountTooLow (Increase the minimal replica count for your container app)](https://aka.ms/containerappscalingrules).

## Cache for Redis

### Availability may be impacted from high memory fragmentation. Increase fragmentation memory reservation to avoid potential impact.

Fragmentation and memory pressure can cause availability incidents during a failover or management operations. Increasing reservation of memory for fragmentation helps in reducing the cache failures when running under high memory pressure. Memory for fragmentation can be increased via maxfragmentationmemory-reserved setting available in advanced settings blade.

The production SKUs offer higher number of tunnels, BGP support, active-active, custom IPsec/IKE policy in addition to higher stability and availability.

Learn more about [Virtual network gateway - BasicVPNGateway (Move to production gateway SKUs from Basic gateways)](https://aka.ms/aa_basicvpngateway_learnmore).

### Add at least one more endpoint to the profile, preferably in another Azure region

Profiles should have more than one endpoint to ensure availability if one of the endpoints fails. It is also recommended that endpoints be in different regions.

Learn more about [Traffic Manager profile - GeneralProfile (Add at least one more endpoint to the profile, preferably in another Azure region)](https://aka.ms/AA1o0x4).

### Add an endpoint configured to "All (World)"

For geographic routing, traffic is routed to endpoints based on defined regions. When a region fails, there is no pre-defined failover. Having an endpoint where the Regional Grouping is configured to "All (World)" for geographic profiles will avoid traffic black holing and guarantee service remains available.

Learn more about [Traffic Manager profile - GeographicProfile (Add an endpoint configured to \""All (World)\"")](https://aka.ms/Rf7vc5).

### Add or move one endpoint to another Azure region

All endpoints associated to this proximity profile are in the same region. Users from other regions may experience long latency when attempting to connect. Adding or moving an endpoint to another region will improve overall performance for proximity routing and provide better availability in case all endpoints in one region fail.

Learn more about [Traffic Manager profile - ProximityProfile (Add or move one endpoint to another Azure region)](https://aka.ms/Ldkkdb).

### Implement multiple ExpressRoute circuits in your Virtual Network for cross premises resiliency

Learn more about [ExpressRoute circuit - ExpressRouteGatewayE2EMonitoring (Implement ExpressRoute Monitor on Network Performance Monitor for end-to-end monitoring of your ExpressRoute circuit)](../expressroute/how-to-npm.md).

### Avoid hostname override to ensure site integrity

Try to avoid overriding the hostname when configuring Application Gateway.  Having a different domain on the frontend of Application Gateway than the one which is used to access the backend can potentially lead to cookies or redirect urls being broken.  Note that this might not be the case in all situations and that certain categories of backends (like REST API's) in general are less sensitive to this.  Make sure the backend is able to deal with this or update the Application Gateway configuration so the hostname does not need to be overwritten towards the backend.  When used with App Service, attach a custom domain name to the Web App and avoid use of the `*.azurewebsites.net` host name towards the backend.

Learn more about [Application gateway - AppGatewayHostOverride (Avoid hostname override to ensure site integrity)](https://aka.ms/appgw-advisor-usecustomdomain).

### Use ExpressRoute Global Reach to improve your design for disaster recovery

You appear to have ExpressRoute circuits peered in at least two different locations. Connect them to each other using ExpressRoute Global Reach to allow traffic to continue flowing between your on-premises network and Azure environments in the event of one circuit losing connectivity. You can establish Global Reach connections between circuits in different peering locations within the same metro or across metros.

Learn more about [ExpressRoute circuit - UseGlobalReachForDR (Use ExpressRoute Global Reach to improve your design for disaster recovery)](../expressroute/about-upgrade-circuit-bandwidth.md).
