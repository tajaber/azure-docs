# What is the Azure Space Partner Community?

At Microsoft, our mission is to empower every person and every organization on the planet to achieve more.  When it comes to space, we’re investing in building the tools that will allow every person and organization on Earth to realize the incredible potential of space.   

We're a partner-led and ecosystem-focused platform. Our approach to space is multi-band, multi-vendor, and multi-orbit. Our thriving ecosystem of space partners allows for the most comprehensive and innovative offerings for our joint customers and the future of space computing.
