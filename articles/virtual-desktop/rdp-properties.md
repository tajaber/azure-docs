# Supported RDP properties with Azure Virtual Desktop

Organizations can configure Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) properties centrally in Azure Virtual Desktop to determine how a connection to Azure Virtual Desktop should behave. There are a wide range of RDP properties that can be set, such as for device redirection, display settings, session behavior, and more. For more information, see [Customize RDP properties for a host pool](customize-rdp-properties.md).

> [!NOTE]
> Supported RDP properties differ when using Azure Virtual Desktop compared to Remote Desktop Services. Use the following tables to understand each setting and whether it applies when connecting to Azure Virtual Desktop, Remote Desktop Services, or both.
