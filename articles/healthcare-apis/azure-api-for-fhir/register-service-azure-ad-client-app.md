# Register a service client application in Azure Active Directory for Azure API for FHIR

In this article, you'll learn how to register a service client application in Azure Active Directory (Azure AD). Client application registrations are Azure AD representations of applications that can be used to authenticate and obtain tokens. A service client is intended to be used by an application to obtain an access token without interactive authentication of a user. It will have certain application permissions and use an application secret (password) when obtaining access tokens.

Follow these steps to create a new service client.

## App registrations in Azure portal

1. In the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com), navigate to **Azure Active Directory**.

2. Select **App registrations**.

3. Select **New registration**.

4. Give the service client a display name. Service client applications typically don't use a reply URL.

## Application secret

The service client needs a secret (password) to obtain a token.

1. Select **Certificates & secrets**.
2. Select **New client secret**.

3. Provide a description and duration of the secret (either one year, two years or never).

4. Once the secret has been generated, it will only be displayed once in the portal. Make a note of it and store in a secure location.

## Next steps
