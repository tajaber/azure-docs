# Logging for Azure Health Data Services

The Azure platform provides three types of logs, activity logs, resource logs and Azure Active Directory logs. For more information, see [activity logs](../azure-monitor/essentials/platform-logs-overview.md). In this article, youâ€™ll learn about how logging works for the Azure Health Data Services.

## AuditLogs
While activity logs are available for each Azure resource from the Azure portal, Azure Health Data Services emits resource logs, which include two categories of logs, AuditLogs and DiagnosticLogs.

- AuditLogs provide auditing trails for healthcare services. For example, a caller's IP address and resource URL are logged when a user or application accesses the FHIR service. Each service emits required properties and optionally implements additional properties.
- DiagnosticLogs provides insight into the operation of the service, for example, log level (information, warning or error) and log message.

At this time, Azure Health Data Services only supports AuditLogs.

Below is one example of the AuditLog.

```
{
    "time": "2021-08-02 16:01:29Z",
    "resourceId": "/SUBSCRIPTIONS/xxx/RESOURCEGROUPS/xxx/PROVIDERS/MICROSOFT.HEALTHCAREAPIS/SERVICES/xxx",
    "operationName": "Microsoft.HealthcareApis/services/fhir-R4/search-type",
    "category": "AuditLogs",
    "resultType": "Started",
    "resultSignature": 0,
    "durationMs": 0,
    "callerIpAddress": "::ffff:73.164.17.31",
    "correlationId": "5d04211aaf172d43b83d9eb500464ec5",
    "identity": {
        "claims": {
            "iss": "https://sts.windows.net/xxx/",
            "oid": "xxx"
        }
    },
    "level": "Informational",
    "location": "South Central US",
    "uri": "https://xxx.azurehealthcareapis.com:443/Patient",
    "properties": {
        "fhirResourceType": "Patient"
    }
}
```
