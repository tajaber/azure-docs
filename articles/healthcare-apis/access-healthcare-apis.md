# Access Azure Health Data Services

In this article, you'll learn about the different ways to access Azure Health Data Services in your applications. After you've provisioned a FHIR service, DICOM service, or MedTech service, you can then access them in your applications using tools like Postman, cURL, REST Client in Visual Studio Code, and with programming languages such as Python and C#.

## Access the FHIR service

- [Access the FHIR service using Postman](././fhir/use-postman.md)
- [Access the FHIR service using cURL](././fhir/using-curl.md)
- [Access the FHIR service using REST Client](././fhir/using-rest-client.md)

## Access the DICOM service

- [Access the DICOM service using Python](dicom/dicomweb-standard-apis-python.md)
- [Access the DICOM service using cURL](dicom/dicomweb-standard-apis-curl.md)
- [Access the DICOM service using C#](dicom/dicomweb-standard-apis-c-sharp.md)

## Access MedTech service

The MedTech service works with the IoT Hub and Event Hubs in your subscription to receive message data, and the FHIR service to persist the data.

- [Receive device data through Azure IoT Hub](iot/device-data-through-iot-hub.md)
- [Access the FHIR service using Postman](fhir/use-postman.md)
- [Access the FHIR service using cURL](fhir/using-curl.md)
- [Access the FHIR service using REST Client](fhir/using-rest-client.md)
