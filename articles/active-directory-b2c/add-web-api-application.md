# Add a web API application to your Azure Active Directory B2C tenant

This article shows you how to register web API resources in your Azure Active Directory B2C (Azure AD B2C) tenant so that they can accept and respond to requests by client applications that present an access token.

To register an application in your Azure AD B2C tenant, you can use the Azure portal's new unified **App registrations** experience or the legacy **Applications (Legacy)** experience. [Learn more about the new experience](./app-registrations-training-guide.md).

#### [App registrations](#tab/app-reg-ga/)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Select the **Directories + subscriptions** icon in the portal toolbar.
1. On the **Portal settings | Directories + subscriptions** page, find your Azure AD B2C directory in the **Directory name** list, and then select **Switch**.
1. In the left menu, select **Azure AD B2C**. Or, select **All services** and search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Select **App registrations**, and then select **New registration**.
1. Enter a **Name** for the application. For example, *webapi1*.
1. Under **Redirect URI**, select **Web**, and then enter an endpoint where Azure AD B2C should return any tokens that your application requests. In a production application, you might set the redirect URI an endpoint like `https://localhost:5000`. During development or testing, you can set it to `https://jwt.ms`, a Microsoft-owned web application that displays the decoded contents of a token (the contents of the token never leave your browser). You can add and modify redirect URIs in your registered applications at any time.
1. Select **Register**.
1. Record the **Application (client) ID** for use in your web API's code.


#### [Applications (Legacy)](#tab/applications-legacy/)

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).
1. Make sure you're using the directory that contains your Azure AD B2C tenant. Select the **Directories + subscriptions** icon in the portal toolbar.
1. On the **Portal settings | Directories + subscriptions** page, find your Azure AD B2C directory in the **Directory name** list, and then select **Switch**.
1. Choose **All services** in the top-left corner of the Azure portal, and then search for and select **Azure AD B2C**.
1. Select **Applications (Legacy)**, and then select **Add**.
1. Enter a name for the application. For example, *webapi1*.
1. For **Include web app/ web API** and **Allow implicit flow**, select **Yes**.
1. For **Reply URL**, enter an endpoint where Azure AD B2C should return any tokens that your application requests. In your production application, you might set the reply URL to a value such as `https://localhost:44332`. For testing purposes, set the reply URL to `https://jwt.ms`.
1. For **App ID URI**, enter the identifier used for your web API. The full identifier URI including the domain is generated for you. For example, `https://contosotenant.onmicrosoft.com/api`.
1. Select **Create**.
1. On the properties page, record the application ID that you'll use when you configure the web application.

## Configure scopes

Scopes provide a way to govern access to protected resources. Scopes are used by the web API to implement scope-based access control. For example, users of the web API could have both read and write access, or users of the web API might have only read access. In this tutorial, you use scopes to define read and write permissions for the web API.

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-scopes](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-scopes.md)]

## Grant permissions

To call a protected web API from an application, you need to grant your application permissions to the API. For example, in [Tutorial: Register an application in Azure Active Directory B2C](tutorial-register-applications.md), a web application named *webapp1* is registered in Azure AD B2C. You can use this application to call the web API.

[!INCLUDE [active-directory-b2c-permissions-api](../../includes/active-directory-b2c-permissions-api.md)]

Your application is registered to call the protected web API. A user authenticates with Azure AD B2C to use the application. The application obtains an authorization grant from Azure AD B2C to access the protected web API.
