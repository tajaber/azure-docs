As an administrator, you can change settings to customize the user experience in your application.

Select **Customization** > **Appearance**, and then:

- To set the masthead logo image, select **Change**.
- To set the browser icon image that appears on browser tabs, select **Change**.
- Under **Browser colors**, you can replace the default browser colors by adding HTML hexadecimal color codes. For more information about color notation for HEX values, see the W3Schools [HTML Colors](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_colors.asp) tutorial.

You can change the application image on the **Application** > **Management** page.
