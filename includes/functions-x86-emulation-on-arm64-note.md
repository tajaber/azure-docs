> Functions doesn't currently support Python function development on ARM64 devices. To develop Python functions on a Mac with an M1 chip, you must run in an emulated x86 environment. To learn more, see [x86 emulation on ARM64](../articles/azure-functions/functions-run-local.md#x86-emulation-on-arm64).
