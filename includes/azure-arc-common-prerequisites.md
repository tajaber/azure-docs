   Additional client tools depending your environment. For a more comprehensive list, see [Client tools](../articles/azure-arc/data/install-client-tools.md).

In addition to the required tools, to complete the tasks, you need [an Azure Arc data controller](../articles/azure-arc/data/plan-azure-arc-data-services.md).
