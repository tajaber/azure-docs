> [!NOTE]
> Some areas of this service have adjustable limits. This is represented in the tables below with the *Adjustable?* column. When the limit can be adjusted, the *Adjustable?* value is *Yes*.
>
>The actual value to which a limit can be adjusted may vary based on each customerâ€™s deployment. Multiple instances of DPS may be required for very large deployments.
>
> If your business requires raising an adjustable limit or quota above the default limit, you can submit a request for additional resources by [opening a support ticket](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Support/HelpAndSupportBlade/newsupportrequest).  **Requesting an increase does not guarantee that it will be granted, as it needs to be reviewed on a case-by-case basis.  Please contact Microsoft support as early as possible during your implementation, to be able to determine if your request could be approved and plan accordingly.**
