Support for this feature might be impacted by enabling Data Lake Storage Gen2, Network File System (NFS) 3.0 protocol, or the SSH File Transfer Protocol (SFTP). 

If you've enabled any of these capabilities, see [Blob Storage feature support in Azure Storage accounts](../articles/storage/blobs/storage-feature-support-in-storage-accounts.md) to assess support for this feature.
