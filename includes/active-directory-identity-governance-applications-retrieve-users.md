### Retrieve the IDs of the users in Azure AD

This section shows how to interact with Azure AD by using [Microsoft Graph PowerShell](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph) cmdlets. 

The first time your organization uses these cmdlets for this scenario, you need to be in a Global Administrator role to allow Microsoft Graph PowerShell to be used in your tenant. Subsequent interactions can use a lower-privileged role, such as:

- User Administrator, if you anticipate creating new users.
- Application Administrator or [Identity Governance Administrator](../articles/active-directory/roles/permissions-reference.md#identity-governance-administrator), if you're just managing application role assignments.

1. Open PowerShell.
1. If you don't have the [Microsoft Graph PowerShell modules](https://www.powershellgallery.com/packages/Microsoft.Graph) already installed, install the `Microsoft.Graph.Users` module and others by using this command:

   ```powershell
   Install-Module Microsoft.Graph
   ```

   If you already have the modules installed, ensure that you're using a recent version: 

   ```powershell
   Update-Module microsoft.graph.users,microsoft.graph.identity.governance,microsoft.graph.applications
   ```

1. Connect to Azure AD:

   ```powershell
   $msg = Connect-MgGraph -ContextScope Process -Scopes "User.Read.All,Application.ReadWrite.All,AppRoleAssignment.ReadWrite.All,EntitlementManagement.ReadWrite.All"
   ```

1. Read the list of users obtained from the application's data store into the PowerShell session. If the list of users was in a CSV file, you can use the PowerShell cmdlet `Import-Csv` and provide the name of the file from the previous section as an argument. 

   For example, if the file is named *users.csv* and located in the current directory, enter this command:

   ```powershell
   $filename = ".\users.csv"
   $dbusers = Import-Csv -Path $filename -Encoding UTF8
   ```

1. Choose the column of the *users.csv* file that will match with an attribute of a user in Azure AD.

   For example, you might have users in the database where the value in the column named `EMail` is the same value as in the Azure AD attribute `mail`:

   ```powershell
   $db_match_column_name = "EMail"
   $azuread_match_attr_name = "mail"
   ```

1. Retrieve the IDs of those users in Azure AD.

   The following PowerShell script uses the `$dbusers`, `$db_match_column_name`, and `$azuread_match_attr_name` values specified earlier. It will query Azure AD to locate a user that has an attribute with a matching value for each record in the source file. If there are many users in the database, this script might take several minutes to finish.  If you don't have an attribute in Azure AD that has the value, and need to use a `contains` or other filter expression, then you will need to customize this script and that in step 11 below to use a different filter expression.

   ```powershell
   $dbu_not_queried_list = @()
   $dbu_not_matched_list = @()
   $dbu_match_ambiguous_list = @()
   $dbu_query_failed_list = @()
   $azuread_match_id_list = @()
   $azuread_not_enabled_list = @()
   $dbu_values = @()
   $dbu_duplicate_list = @()

   foreach ($dbu in $dbusers) { 
      if ($null -ne $dbu.$db_match_column_name -and $dbu.$db_match_column_name.Length -gt 0) { 
         $val = $dbu.$db_match_column_name
         $escval = $val -replace "'","''"
         if ($dbu_values -contains $escval) { $dbu_duplicate_list += $dbu; continue } else { $dbu_values += $escval }
         $filter = $azuread_match_attr_name + " eq '" + $escval + "'"
         try {
            $ul = @(Get-MgUser -Filter $filter -All -Property Id,accountEnabled -ErrorAction Stop)
            if ($ul.length -eq 0) { $dbu_not_matched_list += $dbu; } elseif ($ul.length -gt 1) {$dbu_match_ambiguous_list += $dbu } else {
               $id = $ul[0].id; 
               $azuread_match_id_list += $id;
               if ($ul[0].accountEnabled -eq $false) {$azuread_not_enabled_list += $id }
            } 
         } catch { $dbu_query_failed_list += $dbu } 
       } else { $dbu_not_queried_list += $dbu }
   }

   ```

1. View the results of the previous queries. See if any of the users in the database couldn't be located in Azure AD, because of errors or missing matches.

   The following PowerShell script will display the counts of records that weren't located:

   ```powershell
   $dbu_not_queried_count = $dbu_not_queried_list.Count
   if ($dbu_not_queried_count -ne 0) {
     Write-Error "Unable to query for $dbu_not_queried_count records as rows lacked values for $db_match_column_name."
   }
   $dbu_duplicate_count = $dbu_duplicate_list.Count
   if ($dbu_duplicate_count -ne 0) {
     Write-Error "Unable to locate Azure AD users for $dbu_duplicate_count rows as multiple rows have the same value"
   }
   $dbu_not_matched_count = $dbu_not_matched_list.Count
   if ($dbu_not_matched_count -ne 0) {
     Write-Error "Unable to locate $dbu_not_matched_count records in Azure AD by querying for $db_match_column_name values in $azuread_match_attr_name."
   }
   $dbu_match_ambiguous_count = $dbu_match_ambiguous_list.Count
   if ($dbu_match_ambiguous_count -ne 0) {
     Write-Error "Unable to locate $dbu_match_ambiguous_count records in Azure AD as attribute match ambiguous."
   }
   $dbu_query_failed_count = $dbu_query_failed_list.Count
   if ($dbu_query_failed_count -ne 0) {
     Write-Error "Unable to locate $dbu_query_failed_count records in Azure AD as queries returned errors."
   }
   $azuread_not_enabled_count = $azuread_not_enabled_list.Count
   if ($azuread_not_enabled_count -ne 0) {
    Write-Error "$azuread_not_enabled_count users in Azure AD are blocked from sign-in."
   }
   if ($dbu_not_queried_count -ne 0 -or $dbu_duplicate_count -ne 0 -or $dbu_not_matched_count -ne 0 -or $dbu_match_ambiguous_count -ne 0 -or $dbu_query_failed_count -ne 0 -or $azuread_not_enabled_count) {
    Write-Output "You will need to resolve those issues before access of all existing users can be reviewed."
   }
   $azuread_match_count = $azuread_match_id_list.Count
   Write-Output "Users corresponding to $azuread_match_count records were located in Azure AD." 
   ```

1. When the script finishes, it will indicate an error if any records from the data source weren't located in Azure AD. If not all the records for users from the application's data store could be located as users in Azure AD, you'll need to investigate which records didn't match and why.  

   For example, someone's email address might have been changed in Azure AD without their corresponding `mail` property being updated in the application's data source. Or, the user might have already left the organization but is still in the application's data source. Or there might be a vendor or super-admin account in the application's data source that does not correspond to any specific person in Azure AD.

1. If there were users who couldn't be located in Azure AD, or weren't active and able to sign in, but you want to have their access reviewed or their attributes updated in the database, you need to update or create Azure AD users for them. You can create users in bulk by using either:

   - A CSV file, as described in [Bulk create users in the Azure AD portal](../articles/active-directory/enterprise-users/users-bulk-add.md)
   - The [New-MgUser](/powershell/module/microsoft.graph.users/new-mguser?view=graph-powershell-1.0#examples&preserve-view=true) cmdlet  

   Ensure that these new users are populated with the attributes required for Azure AD to later match them to the existing users in the application.

1. After you add any missing users to Azure AD, run the script from step 6 again. Then run the script from step 7. Check that no errors are reported.

   ```powershell
   $dbu_not_queried_list = @()
   $dbu_not_matched_list = @()
   $dbu_match_ambiguous_list = @()
   $dbu_query_failed_list = @()
   $azuread_match_id_list = @()
   $azuread_not_enabled_list = @()
   $dbu_values = @()
   $dbu_duplicate_list = @()

   foreach ($dbu in $dbusers) { 
      if ($null -ne $dbu.$db_match_column_name -and $dbu.$db_match_column_name.Length -gt 0) { 
         $val = $dbu.$db_match_column_name
         $escval = $val -replace "'","''"
         if ($dbu_values -contains $escval) { $dbu_duplicate_list += $dbu; continue } else { $dbu_values += $escval }
         $filter = $azuread_match_attr_name + " eq '" + $escval + "'"
         try {
            $ul = @(Get-MgUser -Filter $filter -All -Property Id,accountEnabled -ErrorAction Stop)
            if ($ul.length -eq 0) { $dbu_not_matched_list += $dbu; } elseif ($ul.length -gt 1) {$dbu_match_ambiguous_list += $dbu } else {

               if ($ul[0].accountEnabled -eq $false) {$azuread_not_enabled_list += $id }
            } 
         } catch { $dbu_query_failed_list += $dbu } 
       } else { $dbu_not_queried_list += $dbu }
   }
