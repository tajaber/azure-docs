> [!TIP]
> You can use [Postman](https://www.postman.com/downloads/) to try out the REST API calls described in this article. Download the [IoT Central Postman collection](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Azure-Samples/iot-central-docs-samples/main/postman-collection/IoT%20Central.postman_collection.json) and import it into Postman. In the collection, you'll need to set variables such as your app subdomain and admin token.
