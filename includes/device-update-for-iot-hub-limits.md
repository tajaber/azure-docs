> [!NOTE]
> When a given resource or operation doesn't have adjustable limits, the default and the maximum limits are the same. When the limit can be adjusted, the following table includes both the default limit and maximum limit. The limit can be raised above the default limit but not above the maximum limit. Limits can only be adjusted for the Standard SKU. Limit adjustment requests are not accepted for Free SKU. Limit adjustment requests are evaluated on a case-by-case basis and approvals are not guaranteed. 
>
> If you want to raise the limit or quota above the default limit, open an [online customer support request](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/options/).
