> Azure Route Servers created before November 1, 2021, that don't have a public IP address associated, are deployed with the [public preview](https://azure.microsoft.com/support/legal/preview-supplemental-terms/) offering. The public preview offering is not backed by General Availability SLA and support. To deploy Azure Route Server with the General Availability offering, and to achieve General Availability SLA and support, please delete and recreate your Route Server.
