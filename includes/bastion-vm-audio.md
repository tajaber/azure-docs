You can enable remote audio output for your VM. Some VMs automatically enable this setting, others require you to enable audio settings manually. The settings are changed on the VM itself. Your Bastion deployment doesn't need any special configuration settings to enable remote audio output.

To enable remote audio output on a Windows VM:

1. After you're connected to the VM, on the right-hand bottom corner of the toolbar, you'll see an audio button.
1. Right-click the audio button and select "Sounds".
1. A pop-up appears asking if you would like to enable the Windows Audio Service. Select "Yes". You can configure more audio options in Sound preferences.
1. To verify sound output, hover your mouse over the audio button on the toolbar.
