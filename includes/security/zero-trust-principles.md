[Zero Trust](/security/zero-trust/zero-trust-overview) is a security strategy for designing and implementing the following sets of security principles:

|Verify explicitly  |Use least privilege access  |Assume breach  |
|---------|---------|---------|
|Always authenticate and authorize based on all available data points.     | Limit user access with Just-In-Time and Just-Enough-Access (JIT/JEA), risk-based adaptive policies, and data protection.        | Minimize blast radius and segment access. Verify end-to-end encryption and use analytics to get visibility, drive threat detection, and improve defenses.        |
