When users try to sign in to your app, the app starts an authentication request to the authorization endpoint via a [user flow](../articles/active-directory-b2c/user-flow-overview.md). The user flow defines and controls the user experience. After users complete the user flow, Azure AD B2C generates a token and then redirects users back to your application.

If you haven't done so already, [create a user flow or a custom policy](../articles/active-directory-b2c/add-sign-up-and-sign-in-policy.md). Repeat the steps to create three separate user flows as follows: 

- A combined **Sign in and sign up** user flow, such as `susi`. This user flow also supports the **Forgot your password** experience.
- A **Profile editing** user flow, such as `edit_profile`.
- A **Password reset** user flow, such as `reset_password`.

Azure AD B2C prepends `B2C_1_` to the user flow name. For example, `susi` becomes `B2C_1_susi`.
