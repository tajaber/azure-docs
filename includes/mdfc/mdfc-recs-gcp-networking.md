There are **45** GCP recommendations in this category.

|Recommendation |Description |Severity |
|---|---|---|
|[Cluster hosts should be configured to use only private, internal IP addresses to access Google APIs](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/fae39f34-d931-4026-b09c-b0a785bb1ff9) |This recommendation evaluates whether the privateIpGoogleAccess property of a subnetwork is set to false. |High |
|[Compute instances should use a load balancer that is configured to use a target HTTPS proxy](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c3be77f6-6fa9-45bd-9bdb-420484420235) |This recommendation evaluates if the selfLink property of the targetHttpProxy resource matches the target attribute in the forwarding rule, and if the forwarding rule contains a loadBalancingScheme field set to External. |Medium |
|[Control Plane Authorized Networks should be enabled on GKE clusters](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/24df9ba4-8c98-42f2-9f64-50b095eca06f) |This recommendation evaluates the masterAuthorizedNetworksConfig property of a cluster for the key-value pair, 'enabled': false. |High |
|[Egress deny rule should be set on a firewall to block unwanted outbound traffic](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/2acc6ce9-c9a7-4d91-b7c8-f2314ecbf8af) |This recommendation evaluates whether the destinationRanges property in the firewall is set to 0.0.0.0/0 and the denied property contains the key-value pair, 'IPProtocol': 'all'. |Low |
|[Ensure Firewall Rules for instances behind Identity Aware Proxy (IAP) only allow the traffic from Google Cloud Loadbalancer (GCLB) Health Check and Proxy Addresses](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/814c3346-91c9-4e70-90b6-985cfd3e0478) |Access to VMs should be restricted by firewall rules that allow only IAP traffic by ensuring only connections proxied by the IAP are allowed. <br>To ensure that load balancing works correctly health checks should also be allowed.<br>IAP ensure that access to VMs is controlled by authenticating incoming requests.<br> However if the VM is still accessible from IP addresses other than the IAP it may still be possible to send unauthenticated requests to the instance.<br> Care must be taken to ensure that loadblancer health checks are not blocked as this would stop the loadbalancer from correctly knowing the health of the VM and loadbalancing correctly. |Medium |
|[Ensure legacy networks do not exist for a project](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/44995f9b-5963-4a92-8e99-6d68acbc187c) |In order to prevent use of legacy networks, a project should not have a legacy network configured. <br> Legacy networks have a single network IPv4 prefix range and a single gateway IP address for the whole network. The network is global in scope and spans all cloud regions. <br> Subnetworks cannot be created in a legacy network and are unable to switch from legacy to auto or custom subnet networks. Legacy networks can have an impact for high network traffic projects and are subject to a single point of contention or failure. |Medium |
|[Ensure 'log_hostname' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set appropriately](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/989db7d6-71d5-4928-a9a6-c9ab7b8044e9) |PostgreSQL logs only the IP address of the connecting hosts.<br> The "log_hostname" flag controls the logging of "hostnames" in addition to the IP addresses logged.<br> The performance hit is dependent on the configuration of the environment and the host name resolution setup.<br> This parameter can only be set in the "postgresql.conf" file or on the server command line.<br> Logging hostnames can incur overhead on server performance as for each statement logged, DNS resolution will be required to convert IP address to hostname.<br> Depending on the setup, this may be non-negligible.<br> Additionally, the IP addresses that are logged can be resolved to their DNS names later when reviewing the logs excluding the cases where dynamic hostnames are used.<br> This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances. |Low |
|[Ensure no HTTPS or SSL proxy load balancers permit SSL policies with weak cipher suites](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/58c07fca-9c6e-46fa-84a7-642f224a1d18) |Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) policies determine what port Transport Layer Security (TLS) features clients are permitted to use when connecting to load balancers.<br>To prevent usage of insecure features, SSL policies should use (a) at least TLS 1.2 with the MODERN profile; <br> or (b) the RESTRICTED profile, because it effectively requires clients to use TLS 1.2 regardless of the chosen minimum TLS version; <br> or (3) a CUSTOM profile that does not support any of the following features:<br>TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_GCM_SHA256<br>TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_GCM_SHA384<br>TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_128_CBC_SHA<br>TLS_RSA_WITH_AES_256_CBC_SHA<br>TLS_RSA_WITH_3DES_EDE_CBC_SHA<br><br>Load balancers are used to efficiently distribute traffic across multiple servers.<br> Both SSL proxy and HTTPS load balancers are external load balancers, meaning they distribute traffic from the Internet to a GCP network.<br> GCP customers can configure load balancer SSL policies with a minimum TLS version (1.0, 1.1, or 1.2) that clients can use to establish a connection, along with a profile (Compatible, Modern, Restricted, or Custom) that specifies permissible cipher suites.<br> To comply with users using outdated protocols, GCP load balancers can be configured to permit insecure cipher suites.<br> In fact, the GCP default SSL policy uses a minimum TLS version of 1.0 and a Compatible profile, which allows the widest range of insecure cipher suites.<br> As a result, it is easy for customers to configure a load balancer without even knowing that they are permitting outdated cipher suites. |Medium |
|[Ensure that Cloud DNS logging is enabled for all VPC networks](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/c10bad5f-cd86-4ea0-a40c-5d31510da525) |Cloud DNS logging records the queries from the name servers within your VPC to Stackdriver.<br> Logged queries can come from Compute Engine VMs, GKE containers, or other GCP resources provisioned within the VPC.<br>Security monitoring and forensics cannot depend solely on IP addresses from VPC flow logs, especially when considering the dynamic IP usage of cloud resources, HTTP virtual host routing, <br>and other technology that can obscure the DNS name used by a client from the IP address. <br>Monitoring of Cloud DNS logs provides visibility to DNS names requested by the clients within the VPC. <br>These logs can be monitored for anomalous domain names, evaluated against threat intelligence, and<br>Note: For full capture of DNS, firewall must block egress UDP/53 (DNS) <br>and TCP/443 (DNS over HTTPS) to prevent client from using external DNS name server for resolution. |High |
|[Ensure that DNSSEC is enabled for Cloud DNS](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/33509176-9e4d-4238-84ec-984ba67019fa) |Cloud Domain Name System (DNS) is a fast, reliable and cost-effective domain name system that powers millions of domains on the internet. <br> Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) in Cloud DNS enables domain owners to take easy steps to protect their domains against DNS hijacking and man-in-the-middle and other attacks. <br> Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) adds security to the DNS protocol by enabling DNS responses to be validated. <br> Having a trustworthy DNS that translates a domain name like www.example.com into its associated IP address is an increasingly important building block of today's web-based applications. <br> Attackers can hijack this process of domain/IP lookup and redirect users to a malicious site through DNS hijacking and man-in-the-middle attacks. <br> DNSSEC helps mitigate the risk of such attacks by cryptographically signing DNS records. <br> As a result, it prevents attackers from issuing fake DNS responses that may misdirect browsers to nefarious websites. |Medium |
|[Ensure that RDP access is restricted from the Internet](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/8bc8464f-f32a-4b3c-954e-48f9db2d9bcf) |GCP Firewall Rules are specific to a VPC Network. Each rule either allows or denies traffic when its conditions are met. Its conditions allow users to specify the type of traffic, such as ports and protocols, and the source or destination of the traffic, including IP addresses, subnets, and instances.<br />Firewall rules are defined at the VPC network level and are specific to the network in which they are defined. The rules themselves cannot be shared among networks. Firewall rules only support IPv4 traffic. <br />When specifying a source for an ingress rule or a destination for an egress rule by address, an IPv4 address or IPv4 block in CIDR notation can be used. Generic (0.0.0.0/0) incoming raffic from the Internet to a VPC or VM instance using RDP on Port 3389 can be avoided. <br> GCP Firewall Rules within a VPC Network. These rules apply to outgoing (egress) traffic from instances and incoming (ingress) traffic to instances in the network. <br> Egress and ingress traffic flows are controlled even if the traffic stays within the network (for example, instance-to-instance communication). For an instance to have outgoing Internet access, the network must have a valid Internet gateway route or custom route whose destination IP is specified. <br> This route simply defines the path to the Internet, to avoid the most general (0.0.0.0/0) destination IP Range specified from the Internet through RDP with the default Port 3389. Generic access from the Internet to a specific IP Range should be restricted. |High |
|[Ensure that RSASHA1 is not used for the key-signing key in Cloud DNS DNSSEC](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/87356ecc-b718-442d-af22-677bceaeae06) |DNSSEC algorithm numbers in this registry may be used in CERT RRs. <br> Zone signing (DNSSEC) and transaction security mechanisms (SIG(0) and TSIG) make use of particular subsets of these algorithms. <br> The algorithm used for key signing should be a recommended one and it should be strong. <br> Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC) algorithm numbers in this registry may be used in CERT RRs. <br> Zonesigning (DNSSEC) and transaction security mechanisms (SIG(0) and TSIG) make use of particular subsets of these algorithms. <br> The algorithm used for key signing should be a recommended one and it should be strong. <br> When enabling DNSSEC for a managed zone, or creating a managed zone with DNSSEC, the user can select the DNSSEC signing algorithms and the denial-of-existence type. <br> Changing the DNSSEC settings is only effective for a managed zone if DNSSEC is not already enabled. <br> If there is a need to change the settings for a managed zone where it has been enabled, turn DNSSEC off and then re-enable it with different settings. |Medium |
|[Ensure that RSASHA1 is not used for the zone-signing key in Cloud DNS DNSSEC](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/117ad72e-fed7-4dc8-995d-39919b9ba2d9) |DNSSEC algorithm numbers in this registry may be used in CERT RRs. <br> Zone signing (DNSSEC) and transaction security mechanisms (SIG(0) and TSIG) make use of particular subsets of these algorithms. <br> The algorithm used for key signing should be a recommended one and it should be strong. <br> DNSSEC algorithm numbers in this registry may be used in CERT RRs. <br> Zonesigning (DNSSEC) and transaction security mechanisms (SIG(0) and TSIG) make use of particular subsets of these algorithms. <br> The algorithm used for key signing should be a recommended one and it should be strong. <br> When enabling DNSSEC for a managed zone, or creating a managed zone with DNSSEC, the DNSSEC signing algorithms and the denial-of-existence type can be selected. <br> Changing the DNSSEC settings is only effective for a managed zone if DNSSEC is not already enabled. <br> If the need exists to change the settings for a managed zone where it has been enabled, turn DNSSEC off and then re-enable it with different settings. |Medium |

Generic (0.0.0.0/0) incoming traffic from the internet to VPC or VM instance using SSH on Port 22 can be avoided.<br> GCP Firewall Rules within a VPC Network apply to outgoing (egress) traffic from instances and incoming (ingress) traffic to instances in the network. <br>Egress and ingresstraffic flows are controlled even if the traffic stays within the network (for example, instance-to-instance communication). <br>For an instance to have outgoing Internet access, the network must have a valid Internet gateway route or custom route whose destination IP is specified. <br>This route simply defines the path to the Internet, to avoid the most general (0.0.0.0/0) destination IP Range specified from the Internet through SSH with the default Port '22'. <br> Generic access from the Internet to a specific IP Range needs to be restricted. |High |
|[Ensure that the default network does not exist in a project](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/ea1989f3-de6c-4389-8b6c-c8b9a3df1595) |To prevent use of "default" network, a project should not have a "default" network. <br> The default network has a preconfigured network configuration and automatically generates the following insecure firewall rules:<br><ul><li>default-allow-internal: Allows ingress connections for all protocols and ports among instances in the network. </li><li>default-allow-ssh: Allows ingress connections on TCP port 22(SSH) from any source to any instance in the network.</li><li>default-allow-rdp: Allows ingress connections on TCP port 3389(RDP) from any source to any instance in the network.</li><li>default-allow-icmp: Allows ingress ICMP traffic from any source to any instance in the network.</li></ul>These automatically created firewall rules do not get audit logged and cannot be configured to enable firewall rule logging. <br>Furthermore, the default network is an auto mode network, which means that its subnets use the same predefined range of IP addresses, and as a result, it's not possible to use Cloud VPN or VPC Network Peering with the default network. <br>Based on organization security and networking requirements, the organization should create a new network and delete the default network. |Medium |
|[Ensure that the log metric filter and alerts exist for VPC network changes](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/59aef38a-19c2-4663-97a7-4c82a98dbab5) |It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network changes.  <br>It is possible to have more than one VPC within a project. In addition, it is also possible to create a peer connection between two VPCs enabling network traffic to route between VPCs. <br>Monitoring changes to a VPC will help ensure VPC traffic flow is not getting impacted. |Low |
|[Ensure that the log metric filter and alerts exist for VPC Network Firewall rule changes](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/4a7723f9-ee51-4a2b-a4e5-2497a20c1964) |It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) Network Firewall rule changes.  <br>Monitoring for Create or Update Firewall rule events gives insight to network access changes and may reduce the time it takes to detect suspicious activity. |Low |
|[Ensure that the log metric filter and alerts exist for VPC network route changes](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/b5c8e32b-a400-4d4b-8d2d-c5afbd4a6997) |It is recommended that a metric filter and alarm be established for Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) network route changes.  <br>Google Cloud Platform (GCP) routes define the paths network traffic takes from a VM instance to another destination. The other destination can be inside the organization VPC network (such as another VM) or outside of it. Every route consists of a destination and a next hop. Traffic whose destination IP is within the destination range is sent to the next hop for delivery. <br>Monitoring changes to route tables will help ensure that all VPC traffic flows through an expected path. |Low |
|[Ensure that the 'log_connections' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on'](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/4016e27f-a451-4e24-9222-39d7d107ad74) |Enabling the log_connections setting causes each attempted connection to the server to be logged, along with successful completion of client authentication. This parameter cannot be changed after the session starts.<br />PostgreSQL does not log attempted connections by default. Enabling the log_connections setting will create log entries for each attempted connection as well as successful completion of client authentication which can be useful in troubleshooting issues and to determine any unusual connection attempts to the server. <br /> This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances. |Medium |
|[Ensure that the 'log_disconnections' database flag for Cloud SQL PostgreSQL instance is set to 'on'](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/a86f62be-7402-4797-91dc-8ba2b976cb74) |Enabling the log_disconnections setting logs the end of each session, including the session duration.<br />PostgreSQL does not log session details such as duration and session end by default. Enabling the log_disconnections setting will create log entries at the end of each session which can be useful in troubleshooting issues and determine any unusual activity across a time period. <br />The log_disconnections and log_connections work hand in hand and generally, the pair would be enabled/disabled together. This recommendation is applicable to PostgreSQL database instances. |Medium |
|[Ensure that VPC Flow Logs is enabled for every subnet in a VPC Network](https://portal.azure.com/#blade/Microsoft_Azure_Security/RecommendationsBlade/assessmentKey/25631aaa-3866-43ac-860f-22c12bff1a4b) |Flow Logs is a feature that enables users to capture information about the IP traffic going to and from network interfaces in the organization's VPC Subnets. Once a flow log is created, the user can view and retrieve its data in Stackdriver Logging. <br> It is recommended that Flow Logs be enabled for every business-critical VPC subnet.<br>VPC networks and subnetworks provide logically isolated and secure network partitions where GCP resources can be launched. When Flow Logs is enabled for a subnet, VMs within that subnet start reporting on all Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) and User Datagram Protocol (UDP) flows. <br> Each VM samples the TCP and UDP flows it sees, inbound and outbound, whether the flow is to or from another VM, a host in the on-premises datacenter, a Google service, or a host on the Internet. If two GCP VMs are communicating, and both are in subnets that have VPC Flow Logs enabled, both VMs report the flows.<br>Flow Logs supports the following use cases: 1. Network monitoring. 2. Understanding network usage and optimizing network traffic expenses. 3. Network forensics. 4. Real-time security analysis<br>Flow Logs provide visibility into network traffic for each VM inside the subnet and can be used to detect anomalous traffic or insight during security workflows. |Low |
