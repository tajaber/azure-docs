Azure hosts Azure Cloud Shell, an interactive shell environment that you can use through your browser. You can use either Bash or PowerShell with Cloud Shell to work with Azure services. You can use the Cloud Shell preinstalled commands to run the code in this article, without having to install anything on your local environment.

To start Azure Cloud Shell:

| Option | Example/Link |
|-----------------------------------------------|---|
| Select **Try It** in the upper-right corner of a code or command block. Selecting **Try It** doesn't automatically copy the code or command to Cloud Shell. | ![Screenshot that shows an example of Try It for Azure Cloud Shell.](./media/cloud-shell-try-it/hdi-azure-cli-try-it.png) |
| Go to [https://shell.azure.com](https://shell.azure.com), or select the **Launch Cloud Shell** button to open Cloud Shell in your browser. | [![Screenshot that shows how to launch Cloud Shell in a new window.](media/cloud-shell-try-it/hdi-launch-cloud-shell.png)](https://shell.azure.com) |
